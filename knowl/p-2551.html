<p>Image illustrating the transformation of an unbalanced binary tree using a right rotation. The initial tree on the left has the root node "E" with a balance factor of 2, making it left-heavy. Node "E" has a left child "C," which in turn has children "B" and "D." Node "B" further has a left child "A." An arrow points to the balanced tree on the right, where "C" becomes the new root. Node "E" becomes the right child of "C," while "B" remains the left child of "C" and "A" remains the left child of "B." Node "D" is repositioned as the left child of "E." The resulting tree is balanced, with updated relationships between nodes to satisfy the balance factor constraints.</p>
