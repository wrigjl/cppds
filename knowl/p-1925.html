<p>Image depicting a hashing algorithm that uses ordinal values of characters with weighting by their positions. The character 'c' in position 1 is multiplied by its ordinal value '99' and added to 1, 'a' in position 2 is multiplied by '97' and added to 2, and 't' in position 3 is multiplied by '116' and added to 3. The resulting sums are combined to total '641'. This sum is then divided by 11, as shown by the operation '641 % 11', resulting in a hash value of '3'.</p>
