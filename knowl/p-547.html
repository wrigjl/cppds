<ul class="disc">
<li><p>Computer science is the study of problem solving.</p></li>
<li><p>Computer science uses abstraction as a tool for representing both processes and data.</p></li>
<li><p>Abstract data types allow programmers to manage the complexity of a problem domain by hiding the details of the data.</p></li>
<li><p>C++ is a powerful object-oriented language.</p></li>
<li><p>All variables must be declared before use in C++.</p></li>
<li><p>C++ has typical built-in numeric types: <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">int</code> is for integers and <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">float</code> and <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">double</code> are used for floating point depending on the number of digits desired.</p></li>
<li><p>C++ has the Boolean type <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">bool</code> that holds <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">true</code> or <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">false</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>The character data type <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">char</code> holds a single character which is encased in single quotes.</p></li>
<li><p>Pointers are a type of variable that stores a memory address. To declare a pointer, an  <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">*</code> is used before the variable name that is supposed to store the location.</p></li>
<li><p>A statically allocated C++ array is an ordered collection of one or more C++ data values of identical type stored in contiguous memory.</p></li>
<li><p>A vector is a dynamically allocated array with many useful methods.</p></li>
<li><p>C++ strings are a sequential collection of zero or more characters.</p></li>
<li><p>A hash table is used to store keys-value pairs. It applies a related hash function to the key in order to compute the location of the associated value. Look-up is typically very fast.</p></li>
<li><p>A set is an unordered collection of unique values.</p></li>
<li><p>Arrays, vectors, and strings are C++ sequential collections.</p></li>
<li><p>Hash tables and sets are nonsequential collections of data.</p></li>
<li><p>In C++, a function definition requires a name, a group of parameters, a return type, and a body.</p></li>
<li><p>Non-fruitful functions in C++ must contain the keyword <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">void</code> in its function definition.</p></li>
<li><p>You can pass variables by value as well as by reference in C++ functions. Passing by reference utilizes the use of pointers.</p></li>
<li><p>Pass by reference is useful when you require a function to return multiple variables.</p></li>
<li><p>To pass an array to a function you need to use an array parameter. The array parameter is denoted by the array variable name followed by set of square brackets ([ and ]).</p></li>
<li><p>Defining a new meaning for an already existing operator (such as the arithmetic operators plus “+” or times “*”) is called overloading the operator. The operators ::, #, ., and ? are reserved and cannot be overloaded.</p></li>
<li><p>Some operators such as =, [], () and -&gt; can only be overloaded as member functions of a class and not as global functions.</p></li>
<li><p>Classes allow programmers to implement abstract data types.</p></li>
<li><p>Programmers can override standard methods as well as create new methods.</p></li>
<li><p>Classes can be organized into hierarchies.</p></li>
<li><p>A class constructor should always invoke the constructor of its parent before continuing on with its own data and behavior.</p></li>
