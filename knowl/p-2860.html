<p>This image represents a simplified network diagram, showing an overview of connectivity in the internet. Two routers, labeled as Router A and Router B, serve as the central connection points. Router A is connected to a cloud labeled "Internet," which symbolizes the global network. On the right side of Router A, there are connections leading to a desktop computer and a laptop, representing end-user devices. On the left side of Router B, connected to the same internet cloud, are two server icons, indicating server machines. The diagram visually explains how different types of hardware devices interface with the internet through routers, depicting a basic structure of network connectivity.</p>
