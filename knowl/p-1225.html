<p>One of the typical applications for showing a queue in action is to simulate a real situation that requires data to be managed in a FIFO manner. To begin, let's consider the children's game Hot Potato. In this game (see <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-quhotpotato.html" title="Figure 3.13.1">FigureÂ 3.13.1</a>) children line up in a circle and pass an item from neighbor to neighbor as fast as they can. At a certain point in the game, the action is stopped and the child who has the item (the potato) is removed from the circle. Play continues until only one child is left.</p>
