<p>A diagram showing the step-by-step process of removing a node ("17") from a linked list. The list begins with a "head" pointer referencing the first node, which contains the value "54," followed by nodes with values "26," "93," "17," "77," and "31," ending with a vertical line. The process is illustrated in four steps, labeled "Step 0" to "Step 3." - In Step 0, the "current" pointer starts at the "head" node ("54"), and the "previous" pointer is set to null. - In subsequent steps, both "current" and "previous" pointers traverse the list. The "current" pointer moves to each node sequentially while the "previous" pointer follows behind. - By Step 3, "current" points to the target node ("17"), and "previous" points to the preceding node ("93"). At this step, the traversal stops.</p>
