<p>A diagram showing the initialization process for removing a node from a linked list. The list begins with a "head" pointer referencing the first node, which contains the value "54." Subsequent nodes contain values "26," "93," "17," "77," and "31," in that order, ending with a vertical line marking the end of the list. Two variables, "current" and "previous," are introduced for the removal process. The "current" variable initially points to the "head" node, while the "previous" variable points to the null marker (indicated by a vertical line before the "head"). These pointers will be used to traverse and modify the linked list during the removal operation.</p>
