<p>Notice that as we percolate an item up the tree, the heap property is restored between the newly added item and the parent. We also preserve the heap property for any siblings. If an item is very small, we will need to swap it up another level. In fact, we may need to keep swapping until we get to the top of the tree. <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/binheap_lst-heap2.html" title="Listing 8.10.5">ListingÂ 8.10.5</a> shows the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">percUp</code> method, which percolates a new item as far up the tree as it needs to go to maintain the heap property. Here is where our wasted element in <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">heapvector</code> is important. Notice that we can compute the parent of any node by using simple integer division because the parent of a node is computed by dividing the index of the current node by 2.</p>
