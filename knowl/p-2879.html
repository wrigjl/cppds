<p>We will note that to route messages through the Internet, other algorithms are used for finding the shortest path. One of the problems with using Dijkstra's algorithm on the Internet is that you must have a complete representation of the graph in order for the algorithm to run. The implication of this is that every router has a complete map of all the routers in the Internet. In practice this is not the case and other variations of the algorithm allow each router to discover the graph as they go. One such algorithm that you may want to read about is called the “distance vector” routing algorithm.</p>
