<p>Before we begin our study of tree data structures, let's look at a few common examples. Our first example of a tree is a classification tree from biology. <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/trees_examples-biotree.html" title="Figure 8.2.1">Figure 8.2.1</a> shows an example of the biological classification of some animals. From this simple example, we can learn about several properties of trees. The first property this example demonstrates is that trees are hierarchical. By hierarchical, we mean that trees are structured in layers with the more general things near the top and the more specific things near the bottom. The top of the hierarchy is the Kingdom, the next layer of the tree (the “children” of the layer above) is the Phylum, then the Class, and so on. However, no matter how deep we go in the classification tree, all the organisms are still animals.</p>
