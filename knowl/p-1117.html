<p>When you write an arithmetic expression such as B * C, the form of the expression provides you with information so that you can interpret it correctly. In this case we know that the variable B is being multiplied by the variable C since the multiplication operator * appears between them in the expression. This type of notation is referred to as <dfn class="terminology">infix</dfn> since the operator is <em class="emphasis">in between</em> the two operands that it is working on.</p>
