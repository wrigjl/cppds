<p>Our first problem is to figure out how to turn a large collection of words into a graph. What we would like is to have an edge from one word to another if the two words are only different by a single letter. If we can create such a graph, then any path from one word to another is a solution to the word ladder puzzle. <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-wordladder.html" title="Figure 9.8.1">FigureÂ 9.8.1</a> shows a small graph of some words that solve the FOOL to SAGE word ladder problem. Notice that the graph is an undirected graph and that the edges are unweighted.</p>
