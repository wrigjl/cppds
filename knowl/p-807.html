<p>At first glance you may be tempted to think that this algorithm is <span class="process-math">\(O(n)\text{,}\)</span> since there are three consecutive simple iterations: the first two to convert strings to char arrays and the last to compare the <em class="emphasis">n</em> characters after the sorting process. However, the two calls to the C++ <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">sort</code> function are not without their own cost. As we will see in a later chapter, sorting is typically either <span class="process-math">\(O(n^{2})\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(O(n\log n)\text{,}\)</span> so the sorting operations dominate the iteration. In the end, this algorithm will have the same order of magnitude as that of the sorting process.</p>
