<p>The number of assignment operations is the sum of four terms. The first term is the constant 3, representing the three assignment statements at the start of the fragment. The second term is <span class="process-math">\(3n^{2}\text{,}\)</span> since there are three statements that are performed <span class="process-math">\(n^{2}\)</span> times due to the nested iteration. The third term is <span class="process-math">\(2n\text{,}\)</span> two statements iterated <em class="emphasis">n</em> times. Finally, the fourth term is the constant 1, representing the final assignment statement. This gives us <span class="process-math">\(T(n)=3+3n^{2}+2n+1=3n^{2}+2n+4\text{.}\)</span> By looking at the exponents, we can easily see that the <span class="process-math">\(n^{2}\)</span> term will be dominant and therefore this fragment of code is <span class="process-math">\(O(n^{2})\text{.}\)</span> Note that all of the other terms as well as the coefficient on the dominant term can be ignored as <em class="emphasis">n</em> grows larger.</p>
