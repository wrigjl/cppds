<p>Image showing the process of rebalancing a binary tree using a right rotation followed by a left rotation. The diagram consists of three stages. In the first stage, the unbalanced tree has node "A" as the root with a balance factor of -2. Node "C" is the right child of "A," with a balance factor of 1, and "B" is the left child of "C." This configuration necessitates rebalancing. In the second stage, a right rotation is performed around node "C." Node "B" becomes the right child of "A," and "C" becomes the right child of "B." This step resolves the imbalance between nodes "C" and "B." In the third stage, a left rotation is performed around node "A." Node "B" becomes the new root, with "A" as its left child and "C" as its right child. The tree is now fully balanced, with all nodes having a balance factor of 0. Arrows between the stages indicate the direction of the rotations, and balance factors are displayed to emphasize the changes during the process.</p>
