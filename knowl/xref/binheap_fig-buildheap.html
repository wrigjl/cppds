The diagram consists of four stages that represent the percolation process as elements are rearranged to satisfy the heap properties. In the first stage, the initial heap is shown as an unstructured tree with the vector elements arranged in their input order. In the second stage (i = 2), the element at index 2, "5," is percolated down as needed to maintain the heap property, though no swaps are required at this step. In the third stage (i = 1), the element at index 1, "6," is percolated down and swapped with its smaller child, "2," to restore the heap property. In the fourth stage (i = 0), the element at the root, "9," is percolated down through successive swaps with its smaller children ("2" and "3") to reach its proper position in the heap. Each stage is annotated with arrows and labels, illustrating the transformations at each step of the heap-building process.</div></div></details>
