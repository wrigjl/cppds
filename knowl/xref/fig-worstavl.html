Each tree is labeled with nodes and balance factors: - For height 0, the tree contains a single node "A" with a balance factor of 0. - For height 1, the tree has "B" as the root with a balance factor of 1 and "A" as its left child with a balance factor of 0. - For height 2, the tree has "C" as the root with a balance factor of 1. "B" is the left child of "C" with a balance factor of 1, and "A" is the left child of "B" with a balance factor of 0. "D" is the right child of "C" with a balance factor of 0. - For height 3, the tree has "E" as the root with a balance factor of 1. "C" is the left child of "E" with a balance factor of 1. "B" is the left child of "C" with a balance factor of 1, and "A" is the left child of "B" with a balance factor of 0. "D" is the right child of "C" with a balance factor of 0. "G" is the right child of "E" with a balance factor of 1, and "F" is the left child of "G" with a balance factor of 0. This sequence demonstrates the maximum permissible left-heavy configurations in AVL trees while maintaining balance factors of -1, 0, or 1 at all nodes.</div></div></details>
