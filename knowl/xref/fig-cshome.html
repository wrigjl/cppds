The graph is a cluster of interconnected nodes, each representing a different page or external link. Central nodes like "Luther College History Department" have multiple connections radiating out to related nodes such as "Loyola College in Maryland" and "Iowa State University." Peripheral nodes link to a variety of topics, including "Recreational Sports - Luther College," "Luther College Administration," and "Cornell College - Chemistry." The links create a dense web, illustrating the interconnected nature of the websiteâ€™s structure. The graph is used to demonstrate the relationships and pathways between various academic departments, programs, and external educational institutions.'></div>
