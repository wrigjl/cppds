The diagram consists of three stages illustrating how the heap structure property is restored through swaps. In the first stage, a new item labeled "7" is appended as a leaf node under the node "18" in the binary tree, which initially violates the heap structure property. The parent-child relationship is unbalanced because "7" is smaller than its parent "18." In the second stage (swap 1), the new item "7" is swapped with its parent "18," moving up the tree. The new structure partially restores the heap property, but "7" is now a child of node "9," still violating the heap structure. In the third stage (swap 2), "7" is swapped with its new parent "9," percolating up to its proper position. At this point, the heap structure property is fully restored, and the tree satisfies the complete binary heap requirements. Arrows and dashed lines in the diagram highlight the movement of nodes during each swap.</div></div></details>
