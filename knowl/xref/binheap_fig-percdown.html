The diagram consists of four stages illustrating how the heap structure property is restored. In the first stage, the root node "5" is removed, leaving an empty root. The last node in the heap, "27," is moved to the root, creating a temporary imbalance in the heap structure. Arrows indicate the initial swap process. In the second stage (swap 1), the new root "27" is swapped with the smaller of its two children, "9," moving "27" down the tree and partially restoring the heap structure. In the third stage (swap 2), "27" is swapped with its smaller child "14," further percolating it down the tree and improving the heap structure. In the fourth stage (swap 3), "27" is swapped with its child "17," reaching its proper position. The heap structure is now fully restored, maintaining the binary heap properties. Each stage is annotated with arrows and labels indicating the swaps, clearly demonstrating the percolation process.</div></div></details>
