Arrows indicating direction connect the vertices, with weights on each edge. V0 connects to V4 and V1 with weights 1 and 5, respectively. V1 is connected from V0 and to V5 with weights 5 and 4, respectively. V2 connects from V3 and V5 with weights 9 and 1, respectively. V3 connects to V2 and V5 with weights 9 and 3, respectively, and also to V4 with a weight of 7. V4 connects from V0 and V5 with weights 1 and 8, respectively, and to V3 with a weight of 7. V5, at the center, has incoming edges from V1, V3, and V4 with weights 4, 3, and 8, respectively, and outgoing edges to V2 with a weight of 1.</div></div></details>
