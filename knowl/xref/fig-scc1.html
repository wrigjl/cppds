The graph contains nine nodes labeled A through I. Nodes A, B, and C form the first component, with arrows indicating directed edges from A to B, B to A, and B to C. The second component consists of nodes D, E, and G, with directed edges connecting D to E, E to D, and D to G. The third component includes nodes F, H, and I, with edges from F to H, H to I, and I to F. Each component is a self-contained subgraph where every node is reachable from every other node within the same component, illustrating the concept of strong connectivity in graph theory."></div>
