The first node contains the letters "ABDEG," indicating it is a merged node of the first component. The second node is labeled "C," and the third node contains "FHI," representing the second and third components, respectively. There are directed edges from the "ABDEG" node to "C" and from "C" to "FHI," showing the flow between these combined nodes. This reduced graph emphasizes the hierarchical structure and the dependencies between the strongly connected components of the original directed graph.'></div>
