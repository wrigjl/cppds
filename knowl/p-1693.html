<p>As long as we always obey the rule that the larger disks remain on the bottom of the stack, we can use the three steps above recursively, treating any larger disks as though they were not even there. The only thing missing from the outline above is the identification of a base case. The simplest Tower of Hanoi problem is a tower of one disk. In this case, we need move only a single disk to its final destination. A tower of one disk will be our base case. In addition, the steps outlined above move us toward the base case by reducing the height of the tower in steps 1 and 3. <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/lst-movetower.html" title="Listing 5.10.2">Listing 5.10.2</a> shows the code to solve the Tower of Hanoi puzzle.</p>
