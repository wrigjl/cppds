<p>A sequence of diagrams depicting the insertion process into a priority queue represented by a binary tree. Starting with a single node labeled '3', the first diagram shows 'Insert 10', leading to a new node '10' added as a child. The next step 'Insert 5' adds a new node '5', followed by 'Insert 8' which adds node '8'. Another step shows 'Insert 7' with a node '7' being added, and the sequence progresses with each insertion maintaining the binary tree structure. The diagrams show the dynamic reordering of nodes to maintain the priority queue property, with the final structure at the bottom left displaying a balanced binary tree with node '2' at the top, leading to nodes '3' and '7', which branch out to further nodes '10', '8', '5', and '2'. Arrows indicate the insertion order and the adjustments within the tree.</p>
