<p> Hence, it is very common to include the word <dfn class="terminology">computable</dfn> when describing problems and solutions. We say that a problem is computable if an algorithm exists for solving it. An alternative definition for computer science, then, is to say that computer science is the study of problems that are and that are not computable, the study of the existence and the nonexistence of algorithms as well as the analysis of the relative speed of those algorithms. Here, you will note that the word “computer” did not come up at all. Solutions are and should be considered independent from the machine.</p>
