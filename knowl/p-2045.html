<p>Before getting into specific algorithms, we should think about the operations that can be used to analyze a sorting process. First, it will be necessary to compare two values to see which is smaller (or larger). In order to sort a collection, it will be necessary to have some systematic way to compare values to see if they are out of order. The total number of comparisons will be the most common way to measure a sort procedure. Second, when values are not in the correct position with respect to one another, it may be necessary to exchange them. This exchange is a costly operation and the total number of exchanges will also be important for evaluating the overall efficiency of the algorithm.</p>
