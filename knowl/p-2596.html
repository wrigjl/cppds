<li><p>Consider the following array of integers: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]. Show the binary search tree resulting from inserting the integers in the array.</p></li>
<li><p>Consider the following array of integers: [10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1]. Show the binary search tree resulting from inserting the integers in the array.</p></li>
<li><p>Generate a random array of integers. Show the binary heap tree resulting from inserting the integers on the array one at a time.</p></li>
<li><p>Using the array from the previous question, show the binary heap tree resulting from using the array as a parameter to the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">buildHeap</code> method. Show both the tree and array form.</p></li>
<li><p>Draw the binary search tree that results from inserting the following keys in the order given: 68,88,61,89,94,50,4,76,66, and 82.</p></li>

Why must we check before the call to <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">preorder</code> when implementing as a method, whereas we could check inside the call when implementing as a function?</p></li>

The diagram consists of two stages: the initial tree structure and the resulting tree after the rotation. In the initial tree, node "B" is the root, with node "A" as its left child and node "D" as its right child. Node "D" has two subtrees, "C" as its left child and "E" as its right child. After the left rotation, node "D" becomes the new root, with node "B" as its left child and node "E" as its right child. Node "B" retains "A" as its left child and "C" as its right child. The arrow between the two stages indicates the direction of the rotation. This figure demonstrates the rebalancing operation in a binary tree by performing a left rotation.'></div>
