<p>We have already seen that the number of nodes in a binary tree of height N is <span class="process-math">\(2^{N+1}-1\text{.}\)</span> For a tree with nodes that may have up to eight children instead of two the number of nodes is much larger. Because the branching factor of each node is variable, we could estimate the number of nodes using an average branching factor. The important thing to note is that this algorithm is exponential: <span class="process-math">\(k^{N+1}-1\text{,}\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> is the average branching factor for the board. Let's look at how rapidly this grows! For a board that is 5x5 the tree will be 25 levels deep, or N = 24 counting the first level as level 0. The average branching factor is <span class="process-math">\(k = 3.8\)</span> So the number of nodes in the search tree is <span class="process-math">\(3.8^{25}-1\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(3.12 \times 10^{14}\text{.}\)</span> For a 6x6 board, <span class="process-math">\(k = 4.4\text{,}\)</span> there are <span class="process-math">\(1.5
\times 10^{23}\)</span> nodes, and for a regular 8x8 chess board, <span class="process-math">\(k = 5.25\text{,}\)</span> there are <span class="process-math">\(1.3 \times 10^{46}\text{.}\)</span> Of course, since there are multiple solutions to the problem we won't have to explore every single node, but the fractional part of the nodes we do have to explore is just a constant multiplier which does not change the exponential nature of the problem. We will leave it as an exercise for you to see if you can express <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> as a function of the board size.</p>
