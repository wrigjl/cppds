The list starts with a "head" pointer referencing the first node, which contains the value "54." Subsequent nodes contain values "26," "93," "17," "77," and "31," in that order, ending with a vertical line marking the end of the list. The traversal process is indicated by an arrow labeled "traversal," moving from left to right. A variable labeled "current" sequentially points to each node, beginning at the "head" and progressing through the list. The node with the value "17" is circled to indicate it has been located. Dashed arrows illustrate the movement of the "current" pointer during the search process.'></div>
