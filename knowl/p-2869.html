<p>Let's walk through an application of Dijkstra's algorithm one vertex at a time using the following sequence of figures as our guide. We begin with the vertex <span class="process-math">\(u\text{.}\)</span> The three vertices adjacent to <span class="process-math">\(u\)</span> are <span class="process-math">\(v,w,\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(x\text{.}\)</span> Since the initial distances to <span class="process-math">\(v,w,\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> are all initialized to <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">sys.maxint</code>, the new costs to get to them through the start node are all their direct costs. So we update the costs to each of these three nodes. We also set the predecessor for each node to <span class="process-math">\(u\)</span> and we add each node to the priority queue. We use the distance as the key for the priority queue. The state of the algorithm is shown in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-dija.html" title="Figure 9.20.2">FigureÂ 9.20.2</a>.</p>
