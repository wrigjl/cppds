<p>There is one last interesting topic regarding the knight's tour problem, then we will move on to the general version of the depth first search. The topic is performance. In particular, <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">knightTour</code> is very sensitive to the method you use to select the next vertex to visit. For example, on a five-by-five board you can produce a path in about 1.5 seconds on a reasonably fast computer. But what happens if you try an eight-by-eight board? In this case, depending on the speed of your computer, you may have to wait up to a half hour to get the results! The reason for this is that the knight's tour problem as we have implemented it so far is an exponential algorithm of size <span class="process-math">\(O(k^N)\text{,}\)</span> where N is the number of squares on the chess board, and k is a small constant. <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-8array.html" title="Figure 9.14.1">Figure 9.14.1</a> can help us visualize why this is so. The root of the tree represents the starting point of the search. From there the algorithm generates and checks each of the possible moves the knight can make. As we have noted before the number of moves possible depends on the position of the knight on the board. In the corners there are only two legal moves, on the squares adjacent to the corners there are three and in the middle of the board there are eight. <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-nummoves.html" title="Figure 9.14.2">Figure 9.14.2</a> shows the number of moves possible for each position on a board. At the next level of the tree there are once again between 2 and 8 possible next moves from the position we are currently exploring. The number of possible positions to examine corresponds to the number of nodes in the search tree.</p>
