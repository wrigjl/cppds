<p>The image shows a continuation of Dijkstra's Algorithm on a weighted graph. The graph's nodes u, v, w, x, y, and z are connected by directed edges with weights. Node w is the current focus, indicated by the priority queue (PQ) containing only w. Nodes u, x, and v have confirmed shortest paths with solid lines leading to them, and their distances from the starting node u are marked as d=0, d=1, and d=2, respectively. Dashed lines suggest potential paths still under consideration.</p>
