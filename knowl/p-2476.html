<p>A binary search tree (BST) illustrating the deletion of node "25," which has a single child. Initially, node "25" is the right child of the root node "17" and has "35" as its single child. After deletion, node "25" is removed, and its child "35" takes its place in the tree. The tree maintains its BST property, with all nodes correctly positioned in their respective left or right subtrees. An arrow highlights the transition from the initial tree to the updated tree structure.</p>
