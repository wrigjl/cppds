<p>Complex graph showing all legal moves for a knight on an 8 x 8 chessboard, visualized as a network. The nodes are arranged in a grid pattern, numbered from 0 to 63, corresponding to the squares of a chessboard. The lines connecting the nodes represent the knight's potential moves, with each node being connected to others that a knight could reach in a single move based on the rules of chess. The myriad of crisscrossing lines create an intricate web, illustrating the complexity of the knight's movement possibilities across the entire board.</p>
