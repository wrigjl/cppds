<p>While it is relatively easy for humans to look at a road map and understand the relationships between different places, a computer has no such knowledge. However, we can also think of a road map as a graph. When we do so we can have our computer do interesting things for us. If you have ever used one of the Internet map sites, you know that a computer can find the shortest, quickest, or easiest path from one place to another.</p>
