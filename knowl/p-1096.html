<p>The Divide by 2 algorithm assumes that we start with an integer greater than 0. A simple iteration then continually uses integer division to divide the decimal number by 2 and to keep track of the remainder. The first division by 2 gives information as to whether the value is even or odd. When the number is even, dividing it by 2 will leave a remainder of 0, meaning the binary representation of the number will have a 0 in the least significant bit. Conversely, when the number is odd, the remainder will be 1, indicating a 1 in the least significant bit. We think about building our binary number as a sequence of digits; the first remainder we compute will actually be the last digit in the sequence. As shown in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-decbin.html" title="Figure 3.8.1">FigureÂ 3.8.1</a>, we again see the reversal property that signals that a stack is likely to be the appropriate data structure for solving the problem.</p>
