<p>Using integer division to divide 769 by 10, we get 76 with a remainder of 9. This gives us two good results. First, the remainder is a number less than our base that can be converted to a string immediately by lookup. Second, we get a number that is smaller than our original and moves us toward the base case of having a single number less than our base. Now our job is to convert 76 to its string representation. Again we will use integer division plus remainder to get results of 7 and 6 respectively. Finally, we have reduced the problem to converting 7, which we can do easily since it satisfies the base case condition of <span class="process-math">\(n &lt; base\text{,}\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(base = 10\text{.}\)</span> The series of operations we have just performed is illustrated in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-tostr.html" title="Figure 5.5.1">FigureÂ 5.5.1</a>. Notice that the numbers we want to remember are in the remainder boxes along the right side of the diagram.</p>
