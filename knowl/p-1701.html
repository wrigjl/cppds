<p>In this section we will look at a problem that has relevance to the expanding world of robotics: How do you find your way out of a maze? If you have a Roomba vacuum cleaner for your dorm room (don't all college students?) you will wish that you could reprogram it using what you have learned in this section. The problem we want to solve is to find an exit to a virtual maze when starting at a pre-defined location. The maze problem has roots as deep as the Greek myth about Theseus who was sent into a maze to kill the minotaur. Theseus used a ball of thread to help him find his way back out again once he had finished off the beast. In our problem, we will assume that our starting position is dropped down somewhere into the middle of the maze, a fair distance from any exit. Look at <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/recursion-fig-maze.html" title="Figure 5.11.1">FigureÂ 5.11.1</a> to get an idea of where we are going in this section.</p>
