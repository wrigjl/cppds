<p>Which of these two ways to implement <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">preorder</code> is best? The answer is that implementing <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">preorder</code> as an external function is probably better in this case. The reason is that you very rarely want to just traverse the tree. In most cases you are going to want to accomplish something else while using one of the basic traversal patterns. In fact, we will see in the next example that the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">postorder</code> traversal pattern follows very closely with the code we wrote earlier to evaluate a parse tree. Therefore we will write the rest of the traversals as external functions.</p>
