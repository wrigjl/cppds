<p>One of the fundamental building blocks of a computer is something called a flip flop.  It's not something that computer science professors wear on their feet, but rather a kind of circuit that is stable and stores the last piece of data that was put on it.  A simple flip-flop can be made from two <dfn class="terminology">NOR</dfn> gates (a combination <dfn class="terminology">OR</dfn> and <dfn class="terminology">NOT</dfn>) that are tied together as in the following diagram. Create a new gate class, called NorGate. NorGates work like OrGates that have a Not attached to the output. See if you can use your new class to implement this.</p>
