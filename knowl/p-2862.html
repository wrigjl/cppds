<p>Each router on the Internet is connected to one or more other routers. So if you run the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">traceroute</code> command at different times of the day, you are likely to see that your information flows through different routers at different times. This is because there is a cost associated with each connection between a pair of routers that depends on the volume of traffic, the time of day, and many other factors. By this time it will not surprise you to learn that we can represent the network of routers as a graph with weighted edges.</p>
