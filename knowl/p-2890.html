<p>For our last graph algorithm let's consider a problem that online game designers and Internet radio providers face. The problem is that they want to efficiently transfer a piece of information to anyone and everyone who may be listening. This is important in gaming so that all the players know the very latest position of every other player. This is important for Internet radio so that all the listeners that are tuned in are getting all the data they need to reconstruct the song they are listening to. <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-bcast1.html" title="Figure 9.22.1">FigureÂ 9.22.1</a> illustrates the broadcast problem.</p>
