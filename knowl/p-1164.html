<p>The image illustrates the step-by-step evaluation of the postfix expression 4 5 6 * + using a stack. The evaluation is performed from left to right. Initially, the operands 4, 5, and 6 are pushed onto the stack in sequence. When the multiplication operator (*) is encountered, the two most recent operands (5 and 6) are popped from the stack, multiplied to produce 30, and the result is pushed back onto the stack. Next, the addition operator (+) is processed. The two most recent values (4 and 30) are popped, added to produce 34, and the result is pushed back onto the stack. The diagram uses arrows and labeled stack snapshots to show the changes at each step, culminating in the final result of 34.</p>
