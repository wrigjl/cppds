<p>The next step is to figure out how to change state and make progress toward the base case. Since we are working with an integer, let's consider what mathematical operations might reduce a number. The most likely candidates are division and subtraction. While subtraction might work, it is unclear what we should subtract from what. Integer division with remainders gives us a clear direction. Let's look at what happens if we divide a number by the base we are trying to convert to.</p>
