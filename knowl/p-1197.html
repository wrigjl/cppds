<p>Computer science also has common examples of queues. Our computer laboratory has 30 computers networked with a single printer. When students want to print, their print tasks “get in line” with all the other printing tasks that are waiting. The first task in is the next to be completed. If you are last in line, you must wait for all the other tasks to print ahead of you. We will explore this interesting example in more detail later.</p>
