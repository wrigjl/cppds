<p>The advantage of the adjacency matrix is that it is simple, and for small graphs it is easy to see which nodes are connected to other nodes. However, notice that most of the cells in the matrix are empty. Because most of the cells are empty we say that this matrix is “sparse.” A matrix is not a very efficient way to store sparse data. In fact, in C++ you must go out of your way to even create a matrix structure like the one in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-adjmat.html" title="Figure 9.4.1">Figure 9.4.1</a>.</p>
