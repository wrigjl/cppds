<p>We can do much better by using the following approach. Suppose that we have a huge number of buckets, each of them with a four-letter word on the outside, except that one of the letters in the label has been replaced by an underscore. For example, consider <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-wordbucket.html" title="Figure 9.8.2">Figure 9.8.2</a>, we might have a bucket labeled “pop_.” As we process each word in our list we compare the word with each bucket, using the “_” as a wildcard, so both “pope” and “pops” would match “pop_.” Every time we find a matching bucket, we put our word in that bucket. Once we have all the words in the appropriate buckets we know that all the words in the bucket must be connected.</p>
