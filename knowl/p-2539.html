<p>Image illustrating the transformation of an unbalanced binary tree using a left rotation. The initial tree on the left has a root node "A" with a balance factor of -2, indicating it is out of balance. Node "A" has a right child "B" with a balance factor of -1, and node "B" has a right child "C." An arrow points to the resulting balanced tree on the right, where "B" becomes the new root, "A" becomes the left child of "B," and "C" remains the right child of "B." All nodes in the resulting tree have a balance factor of 0, restoring balance to the structure.</p>
