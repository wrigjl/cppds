<p>Now that we have demonstrated that keeping an AVL tree in balance is going to be a big performance improvement, let us look at how we will augment the procedure to insert a new key into the tree. Since all new keys are inserted into the tree as leaf nodes and we know that the balance factor for a new leaf is zero, there are no new requirements for the node that was just inserted. But once the new leaf is added we must update the balance factor of its parent. How this new leaf affects the parent's balance factor depends on whether the leaf node is a left child or a right child. If the new node is a right child the balance factor of the parent will be reduced by one. If the new node is a left child then the balance factor of the parent will be increased by one. This relation can be applied recursively to the grandparent of the new node, and possibly to every ancestor all the way up to the root of the tree. Since this is a recursive procedure let us examine the two base cases for updating balance factors:</p>
