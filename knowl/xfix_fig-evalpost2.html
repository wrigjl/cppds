It shows the operands and operators being processed step by step. Initially, 7 and 8 are pushed onto the stack. When the addition operator (+) is encountered, 7 and 8 are popped, added to produce 15, and the result is pushed back onto the stack. Next, 3 and 2 are pushed onto the stack, and when the addition operator (+) is encountered, 3 and 2 are popped, added to produce 5, and the result is pushed back onto the stack. Finally, the division operator (/) is encountered, and the two values 15 and 5 are popped, divided as 15 / 5 to produce 3, which is pushed back onto the stack as the final result. The image uses arrows and stack snapshots to illustrate the growth and reduction of the stack at each step of the evaluation."></div>
