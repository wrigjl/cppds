<p> It is even possible that a depth first search will create more than one tree. When the depth first search algorithm creates a group of trees we call this a <dfn class="terminology">depth first forest</dfn>. As with the breadth first search our depth first search makes use of predecessor links to construct the tree. In addition, the depth first search will make use of two additional instance variables in the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">Vertex</code> class. The new instance variables are the discovery and finish times. The discovery time tracks the number of steps in the algorithm before a vertex is first encountered. The finish time is the number of steps in the algorithm before a vertex is colored black. As we will see after looking at the algorithm, the discovery and finish times of the nodes provide some interesting properties we can use in later algorithms.</p>
