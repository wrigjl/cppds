<p>The most important piece of information we need to analyze the use of a hash table is the load factor, <span class="process-math">\(\lambda\text{.}\)</span> Conceptually, if <span class="process-math">\(\lambda\)</span> is small, then there is a lower chance of collisions, meaning that items are more likely to be in the slots where they belong. If <span class="process-math">\(\lambda\)</span> is large, meaning that the table is filling up, then there are more and more collisions. This means that collision resolution is more difficult, requiring more comparisons to find an empty slot. With chaining, increased collisions means an increased number of items on each chain.</p>
