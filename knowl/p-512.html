<p>Similarly to tracer settings, every action a turtle takes is also added to the <em class="emphasis">undo queue</em>. This allows it to keep track of actions it is performing over a period of time. The queue is only allowed to grow to a certain size, starting at 100 actions total. This is modifiable through the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">setundobuffer</code> method that belongs to turtles. Every action is added, even if the action doesn't change anything visually. This feature is comparable to the “undo” tool available in most text editors. Turtles can “undo” their progress with the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">undo</code> method.</p>
