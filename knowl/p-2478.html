<p>A binary search tree (BST) illustrating the deletion of a node with two children, specifically node "5." The initial tree has "17" as the root. Node "5," highlighted for deletion, has two children: "2" and "11." To handle this case, the algorithm finds the successor node, which is the smallest node in the right subtree of "5." The successor node, "7," is identified and highlighted. The successor node "7" is removed from its original position and placed in the location of the deleted node "5," preserving the BST properties. The updated tree maintains its hierarchical relationships, with all nodes correctly positioned according to the BST property. An arrow illustrates the transformation from the initial tree to the updated structure.</p>
