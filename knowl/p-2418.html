<p>The image depicts a complete binary tree at the top and its corresponding vector representation at the bottom. The binary tree has a root node labeled '5', which branches out to two nodes labeled '9' on the left and '11' on the right. The '9' node further branches into '14' and '18', which in turn have children '33' and '17', and '27', respectively. The '11' node branches into '19' and '21'. Below the binary tree, there is a vector representation with indexed positions from 0 to 11. The values in the vector are arranged as '5', '9', '11', '14', '18', '19', '21', '33', '17', '27', respecting the binary tree's structure. The image is labeled 'Figure 2: A Complete Binary Tree, along with its Vector Representation'.</p>
