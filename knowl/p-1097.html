<p>The image illustrates the process of converting a decimal number to binary using the Divide by 2 algorithm, leveraging a stack for intermediate storage. The left side shows the sequence of integer division by 2, starting with the number 233, along with the remainders computed at each step. Each remainder is pushed onto the stack. The stack grows as remainders are added, representing the binary digits in reverse order. On the right side, the binary number is constructed by popping values from the stack, producing the binary equivalent of 233 as 11101001. This demonstrates the reversal property of stacks in solving this problem.</p>
