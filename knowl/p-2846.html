<p>The image shows the transpose of the graph  <span class="process-math">\(G^T\)</span> from Figure 33, where the direction of all the edges in the original graph  G has been reversed. In this transposed graph, there is a directed edge from B to A, and two other directed edges, one from D to B and another from D to C, indicating that D can reach both B and C. This represents the inverse relationships compared to the original graph G.</p>
