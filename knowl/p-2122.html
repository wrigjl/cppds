<p>We now turn our attention to using a divide and conquer strategy as a way to improve the performance of sorting algorithms. The first algorithm we will study is the <dfn class="terminology">merge sort</dfn>. Merge sort is a recursive algorithm that continually splits a vector in half. If the vector is empty or has one item, it is sorted by definition (the base case). If the vector has more than one item, we split the vector and recursively invoke a merge sort on both halves. Once the two halves are sorted, the fundamental operation, called a <dfn class="terminology">merge</dfn>, is performed. Merging is the process of taking two smaller sorted vectors and combining them together into a single, sorted, new vector. <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-mergesorta.html" title="Figure 7.7.1">Figure 7.7.1</a> shows our familiar example vector as it is being split by <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">mergeSort</code>. <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-mergesortb.html" title="Figure 7.7.2">Figure 7.7.2</a> shows the simple vectors, now sorted, as they are merged back together.</p>
