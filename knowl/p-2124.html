<p>A diagram depicting the merging phase of the Merge Sort algorithm. The flowchart shows the combination of divided vectors into a sorted sequence. It starts with smaller groups of numbers at the top, each sorted individually: 26 and 54, 17 and 93, and so on. These groups are then merged into larger sorted sequences through a series of downward-pointing arrows, indicating the order of merging. The process continues until all numbers are combined into a single sorted list at the bottom: 17, 20, 26, 31, 44, 54, 55, 77, 93.</p>
