<p>A postfix expression, commonly known as Reverse Polish notation (RPN), is a mathematical notation in which every operator follows its operands. Postfix notation has the advantage of being able to represent a mathematical expression without the need for parentheses, which simplifies the algorithm to process the expression. The order of operations is determined by the position of the operator in relation to its operands. Example: For the infix expression (a + b) * c, the corresponding postfix notation is a b + c *.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="linear-basic_infix-prefix-and-postfix-expressions.html#def-postfix-expression" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
