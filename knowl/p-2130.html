<p>In order to analyze the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">mergeSort</code> function, we need to consider the two distinct processes that make up its implementation. First, the vector is split into halves. We already computed (in a binary search) that we can divide a vector in half <span class="process-math">\(\log n\)</span> times where <em class="emphasis">n</em> is the length of the vector. The second process is the merge. Each item in the vector will eventually be processed and placed on the sorted vector. So the merge operation which results in a vector of size <em class="emphasis">n</em> requires <em class="emphasis">n</em> operations. The result of this analysis is that <span class="process-math">\(\log n\)</span> splits, each of which costs <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> for a total of <span class="process-math">\(n\log n\)</span> operations. A merge sort is an <span class="process-math">\(O(n\log n)\)</span> algorithm.</p>
