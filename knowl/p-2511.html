<p>What is the height of a binary tree likely to be? The answer to this question depends on how the keys are added to the tree. If the keys are added in a random order, the height of the tree is going to be around <span class="process-math">\(\log_2{n}\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> is the number of nodes in the tree. This is because if the keys are randomly distributed, about half of them will be less than the root and half will be greater than the root. Remember that in a binary tree there is one node at the root, two nodes in the next level, and four at the next. The number of nodes at any particular level is <span class="process-math">\(2^d\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(d\)</span> is the depth of the level. The total number of nodes in a perfectly balanced binary tree is <span class="process-math">\(2^{h+1}-1\text{,}\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(h\)</span> represents the height of the tree.</p>
