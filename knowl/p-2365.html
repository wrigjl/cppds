<p>Now that we have examined the basic functionality of our tree data structure, it is time to look at some additional usage patterns for trees. These usage patterns can be divided into the three ways that we access the nodes of the tree. There are three commonly used patterns to visit all the nodes in a tree. The difference between these patterns is the order in which each node is visited. We call this visitation of the nodes a “traversal.” The three traversals we will look at are called <dfn class="terminology">preorder</dfn>, <dfn class="terminology">inorder</dfn>, and <dfn class="terminology">postorder</dfn>. Let's start out by defining these three traversals more carefully, then look at some examples where these patterns are useful.</p>
