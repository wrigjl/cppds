<p>When thinking about a linked data structure, one example is timesharing on an operating system. Timesharing is a computer's way of multitasking. Much like when human's multitask, computers do not actually handle all of its tasks at the same exact time. If you tried to listen to 3 people talk, read a book, and sing a song then you would fail like most people. What you may notice when attempting such a feat is that you pick up on bits and pieces of each separate task. This is due to your attention switching really fast between tasks.</p>
