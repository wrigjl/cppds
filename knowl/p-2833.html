<p>The image depicts the result of a depth-first search on a pancake recipe graph. It starts with "3/4 cup milk" at step 1/12, which along with "1 egg" at step 15/16 and "1 Tbl Oil" at step 17/18, feeds into "1 cup mix" at step 2/11. This leads to "heat griddle" at step 13/14, followed by "pour 1/4 cup" at step 3/8. The next action is "turn when bubbly" at step 4/7, and the final steps are "heat syrup" at step 9/10 and "eat" at step 5/6. Each step is represented by an oval, with directed edges showing the sequence of the recipe steps, and numbers indicating the search progression.</p>
