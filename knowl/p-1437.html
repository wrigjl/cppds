<p>A diagram demonstrating the traversal process of a linked list. The list begins with a "head" pointer referencing the first node, which contains the value "54." Subsequent nodes contain values "26," "93," "17," "77," and "31," in that order, ending with a vertical line that marks the end of the list. The traversal process is indicated by an arrow labeled "traversal," moving from left to right. A variable labeled "current" sequentially points to each node, starting at the "head" and progressing through each node in the list until it reaches the end marker. Dashed arrows illustrate the movement of the "current" pointer as it traverses the list.</p>
