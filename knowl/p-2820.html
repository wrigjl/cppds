<p>A completed depth first search tree with six nodes labeled A to F. The nodes are interconnected with arrows indicating the path of the search. Each node is annotated with two numbers; the first number represents the order in which the node was first visited, and the second number represents the order in which the final visit occurred, marking the nodeâ€™s completion in the search. Node A is labeled "1/12", B "2/11", C "3/4", D "5/10", E "6/9", and F "7/8". This indicates the starting point of the search at node A, the backtracking steps, and the overall path taken to explore all the nodes.</p>
