<p>Image of a search tree representing the possible sequences of moves for a Knight's Tour on a chessboard. The tree structure fans out from a single root node at the top, branching out to successive levels that represent each move of the knight. Each node represents a position on the chessboard, with the links between them representing legal moves of the knight. The breadth of the tree at each level indicates the growing complexity of the tour as more moves are made. The tree is a visual representation of the decision process in computing the tour, with the expansive spread of nodes illustrating the many possible paths the knight can take.</p>
