<p>We could use several different approaches to create the graph we need to solve this problem. Let's start with the assumption that we have a list of words that are all the same length. As a starting point, we can create a vertex in the graph for every word in the list. To figure out how to connect the words, we could compare each word in the list with every other. When we compare we are looking to see how many letters are different. If the two words in question are different by only one letter, we can create an edge between them in the graph. For a small set of words that approach would work fine; however let's suppose we have a list of 5,110 words. Roughly speaking, comparing one word to every other word on the list is an <span class="process-math">\(O(n^2)\)</span> algorithm. For 5,110 words, <span class="process-math">\(n^2\)</span> is more than 26Â million comparisons.</p>
