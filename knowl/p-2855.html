<p>The image displays a directed graph G consisting of nine nodes labeled A through I. Each node is annotated with a pair of numbers, representing the finishing times in the format 'start/finish'. The edges indicate the direction of connection between nodes. Solid arrows represent direct connections, while dashed arrows signify connections that are part of the graph but are not the primary path in the context shown. This graph is likely used to demonstrate an algorithmic concept such as Depth-First Search (DFS), where the numbers indicate the order in which nodes are fully processed.</p>
