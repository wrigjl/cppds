<p>As an example, if we assume that <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">d</code> is a deque that has been created and is currently empty, then <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/linear-basic_tbl-dequeoperations.html" title="Table 3.16.1: Examples of Deque Operations">TableÂ 3.16.1</a> shows the results of a sequence of deque operations. Note that the contents in front are listed on the right. It is very important to keep track of the front and the rear as you move items in and out of the collection as things can get a bit confusing.</p>
