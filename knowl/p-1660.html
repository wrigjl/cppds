<p>To understand how this is going to work it is helpful to think of how we might describe a tree using a fractal vocabulary. Remember that we said above that a fractal is something that looks the same at all different levels of magnification. If we translate this to trees and shrubs we might say that even a small twig has the same shape and characteristics as a whole tree. Using this idea we could say that a <em class="emphasis">tree</em> is a trunk, with a smaller <em class="emphasis">tree</em> going off to the right and another smaller <em class="emphasis">tree</em> going off to the left. If you think of this definition recursively it means that we will apply the recursive definition of a tree to both of the smaller left and right trees.</p>
