<p>Image showing the state of a binary tree after a left rotation around node "A." Node "C" becomes the new root with a balance factor of 2, indicating that its left subtree is much taller than its right subtree. Node "A" becomes the left child of "C," with a balance factor of -1, meaning its right subtree is taller than its left subtree. Node "B" remains the left child of "A," with a balance factor of 0, indicating it is balanced. This new configuration highlights that the tree is now out of balance in the opposite direction, necessitating further adjustments.</p>
