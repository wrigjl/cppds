The first diagram on the left shows a binary tree with the root node '3', which has two children: '7' on the left with its own children '10' and '8', and '5' on the right. An arrow points from this tree to the second diagram on the right, indicating the removal of the root node. The second diagram shows the tree after the root has been removed and the heap has been restructured: the node '5' has been moved to the root position, with '7' as its left child and '3' as its right child, maintaining the heap property. The nodes '10' and '8' remain as children of '7'. The tree restructuring is shown with curved arrows indicating the new parent-child relationships."></div>
