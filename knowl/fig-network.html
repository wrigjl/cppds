The graph consists of six nodes, each representing a router labeled as u, v, w, x, y, and z. The nodes are interconnected by lines that signify the network links between routers. Each line is annotated with a number, representing the weight of the connection, which could indicate the cost, distance, or quality of the link. For instance, router u is connected to router x with a weight of 2, and router x is connected to router v with a weight of 2 and to router y with a weight of 1. This type of graph is typically used to represent the efficiency of data transfer paths in network routing algorithms."></div>
