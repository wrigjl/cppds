<p><a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/xfix_fig-evalpost2.html" title="Figure 3.9.12">FigureÂ 3.9.12</a> shows a slightly more complex example, 7 8 + 3 2 + /. There are two things to note in this example. First, the stack size grows, shrinks, and then grows again as the subexpressions are evaluated. Second, the division operation needs to be handled carefully. Recall that the operands in the postfix expression are in their original order since postfix changes only the placement of operators. When the operands for the division are popped from the stack, they are reversed. Since division is <em class="emphasis">not</em> a commutative operator, in other words <span class="process-math">\(15/5\)</span> is not the same as <span class="process-math">\(5/15\text{,}\)</span> we must be sure that the order of the operands is not switched.</p>
