<p>If the item is not in the list, the only way to know it is to compare it against every item present. If there are <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> items, then the sequential search requires <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> comparisons to discover that the item is not there. In the case where the item is in the list, the analysis is not so straightforward. There are actually three different scenarios that can occur. In the best case we will find the item in the first place we look, at the beginning of the list. We will need only one comparison. In the worst case, we will not discover the item until the very last comparison, the nth comparison.</p>
