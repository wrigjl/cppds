<p>Line 12 allows us to check whether we are dealing with the special case described above. If <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">previous</code> did not move, it will still have the value <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">NULL</code> when the boolean <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">found</code> becomes <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">true</code>. In that case (line 13) the head of the linked list is modified to refer to the node after the current node, in effect removing the first node from the linked list. However, if previous is not <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">NULL</code>, the node to be removed is somewhere down the linked list structure. In this case the previous reference is providing us with the node whose next reference must be changed. Line 15 uses the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">setNext</code> method from <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">previous</code> to accomplish the removal. Note that in both cases the destination of the reference change is <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">current.getNext()</code>. One question that often arises is whether the two cases shown here will also handle the situation where the item to be removed is in the last node of the linked list. We leave that for you to consider.</p>
