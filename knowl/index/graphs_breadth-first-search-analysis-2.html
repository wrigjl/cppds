<div xmlns:pf="https://prefigure.org" class="para"> Before we continue with other graph algorithms let us analyze the run time performance of the breadth first search algorithm. The first thing to observe is that the while loop is executed, at most, one time for each vertex in the graph <span class="process-math">\(|V|\text{.}\)</span> You can see that this is true because a vertex must be white before it can be examined and added to the queue. This gives us <span class="process-math">\(O(V)\)</span> for the while loop. The for loop, which is nested inside the while is executed at most once for each edge in the graph, <span class="process-math">\(|E|\text{.}\)</span> The reason is that every vertex is dequeued at most once and we examine an edge from node <span class="process-math">\(u\)</span> to node <span class="process-math">\(v\)</span> only when node <span class="process-math">\(u\)</span> is dequeued. This gives us <span class="process-math">\(O(E)\)</span> for the for loop. combining the two loops gives us <span class="process-math">\(O(V + E)\text{.}\)</span>
