<div xmlns:pf="https://prefigure.org" class="para">The search algorithm we will use to solve the knight’s tour problem is called <dfn class="terminology">depth first search</dfn> (<dfn class="terminology">DFS</dfn>).  Whereas the breadth first search algorithm discussed in the previous section builds a search tree one level at a time, a depth first search creates a search tree by exploring one branch of the tree as deeply as possible. In this section we will look at two algorithms that implement a depth first search. The first algorithm we will look at directly solves the knight’s tour problem by explicitly forbidding a node to be visited more than once. The second implementation is more general, but allows nodes to be visited more than once as the tree is constructed. The second version is used in subsequent sections to develop additional graph algorithms.</div>
