<div class="para"> The binary heap is interesting to study because when we diagram the heap it looks a lot like a tree, but when we implement it we use only a single vector as an internal representation. The binary heap has two common variations: the <dfn class="terminology">min heap</dfn>, in which the smallest key is always at the front, and the <dfn class="terminology">max heap</dfn>, in which the largest key value is always at the front. In this section we will implement the min heap. We leave a max heap implementation as an exercise.</div>
