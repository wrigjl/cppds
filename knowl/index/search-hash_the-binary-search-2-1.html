<div xmlns:pf="https://prefigure.org" class="para">It is possible to take greater advantage of the ordered vector if we are clever with our comparisons. In the sequential search, when we compare against the first item, there are at most <span class="process-math">\(n-1\)</span> more items to look through if the first item is not what we are looking for.  Instead of searching the vector in sequence, a <dfn class="terminology">binary search</dfn> will start by examining the middle item. If that item is the one we are searching for, we are done. If it is not the correct item, we can use the ordered nature of the vector to eliminate half of the remaining items. If the item we are searching for is greater than the middle item, we know that the entire lower half of the vector as well as the middle item can be eliminated from further consideration. The item, if it is in the vector, must be in the upper half.</div>
