<div class="para">You can probably already see that this technique is going to work only if each item maps to a unique location in the hash table. For example, if the item 44 had been the next item in our collection, it would have a hash value of 0 (<span class="process-math">\(44 \% 11 == 0\)</span>). Since 77 also had a hash value of 0, we would have a problem. According to the hash function, two or more items would need to be in the same slot.This is referred to as a <dfn class="terminology">collision</dfn> (it may also be called a “clash”).  Clearly, collisions create a problem for the hashing technique. We will discuss them in detail later.</div>
