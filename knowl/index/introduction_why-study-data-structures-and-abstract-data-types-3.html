<div xmlns:pf="https://prefigure.org" class="para"> Earlier, we referred to procedural abstraction as a process that hides the details of a particular function to allow the user or client to view it at a very high level. We now turn our attention to a similar idea, that of <dfn class="terminology">data abstraction</dfn>. An <dfn class="terminology">abstract data type</dfn>, sometimes abbreviated <dfn class="terminology">ADT</dfn>, is a logical description of how we view the data and the operations that are allowed without regard to how they will be implemented. This means that we are concerned only with what the data is representing and not with how it will eventually be constructed. By providing this level of abstraction, we are creating an <dfn class="terminology">encapsulation</dfn> around the data. The idea is that by encapsulating the details of the implementation, we are hiding them from the userâ€™s view. This is called <dfn class="terminology">information hiding</dfn>.</div>
