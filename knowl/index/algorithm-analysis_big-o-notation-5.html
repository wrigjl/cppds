<div xmlns:pf="https://prefigure.org" class="para">Computer scientists prefer to take this analysis technique one step further. It turns out that the exact number of operations is not as important as determining the most dominant part of the <span class="process-math">\(T(n)\)</span> function. In other words, as the problem gets larger, some portion of the <span class="process-math">\(T(n)\)</span> function tends to overpower the rest. This dominant term is what, in the end, is used for comparison. The <dfn class="terminology">order of magnitude</dfn> function describes the part of <span class="process-math">\(T(n)\)</span> that increases the fastest as the value of <em class="emphasis">n</em> increases. Order of magnitude is often called <dfn class="terminology">Big-O notation</dfn> (for “order”) and written as <span class="process-math">\(O(f(n))\text{.}\)</span> It provides a useful approximation to the actual number of steps in the computation. The function <span class="process-math">\(f(n)\)</span> provides a simple representation of the dominant part of the original <span class="process-math">\(T(n)\text{.}\)</span>
