<div xmlns:pf="https://prefigure.org" class="para"> This is an example of <dfn class="terminology">procedural abstraction</dfn>. We do not necessarily know how the square root is being calculated, but we know what the function is called and how to use it. If we perform the import correctly, we can assume that the library is correct and any function using it will provide us with the correct results. We know that someone implemented a solution to the square root problem and we only need to know how to use it. This is sometimes referred to as a “black box” view of a process. We simply describe the interface: the name of the function, what is needed (the parameters), and what will be returned. The details are hidden inside (see <a href="introduction_what-is-computer-science.html#fig-procabstraction" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/xref/fig-procabstraction.html" data-reveal-label="Reveal" data-close-label="Close" title="Figure 1.3.1">Figure 1.3.1</a>).</div>
