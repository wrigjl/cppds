<div xmlns:pf="https://prefigure.org" class="para"> Another classic problem that we can use to illustrate a second common graph algorithm is called the “knight’s tour.” The knight’s tour puzzle is played on a chess board with a single chess piece, the knight. The object of the puzzle is to find a sequence of moves that allow the knight to visit every square on the board exactly once. One such sequence is called a “tour.” The knight’s tour puzzle has fascinated chess players, mathematicians and computer scientists alike for many years. The upper bound on the number of possible legal tours for an eight-by-eight chessboard is known to be <span class="process-math">\(1.305 \times 10^{35}\text{;}\)</span> however, there are even more possible dead ends. Clearly this is a problem that requires some real brains, some real computing power, or both.</div>
