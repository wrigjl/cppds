<p>Consider these three expressions again (see <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/linear-basic_tbl-parexample.html" title="Table 3.9.3: An Expression with Parentheses">TableÂ 3.9.3</a>). Something very important has happened. Where did the parentheses go? Why don't we need them in prefix and postfix? The answer is that the operators are no longer ambiguous with respect to the operands that they work on. Only infix notation requires the additional symbols. The order of operations within prefix and postfix expressions is completely determined by the position of the operator and nothing else. In many ways, this makes infix the least desirable notation to use.</p>
