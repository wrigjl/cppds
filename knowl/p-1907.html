<p>In previous sections we were able to make improvements on our search algorithms by taking advantage of information about where items are stored in the collection with respect to one another. For example, by knowing that a list was ordered, we could search in logarithmic time using a binary search. In this section we will attempt to go one step further by building a data structure that can be searched in <span class="process-math">\(O(1)\)</span> by using <dfn class="terminology">hashing</dfn>.</p>
