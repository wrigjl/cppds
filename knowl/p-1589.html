<p>It is important to note that regardless of whether or not a recursive function implements these three rules, it may still take an unrealistic amount of time to compute (and thus not be particularly useful). A great example of this is the ackermann function (shown in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/ackermann.html" title="Listing 5.4.1">ListingÂ 5.4.1</a>), named after Wilhelm Ackermann, which recursively expands to unrealistic proportions. An example as to how many calls this function makes to itself is the case of ackermann(4,3). In this case, it calls itself well over 100 billion times, with an average time of expected completion that falls after the predicted end of the universe. Despite this, it will eventually come to an answer, but you probably won't be around to see it. This goes to show that the efficiency of recursive functions are largely dependent on how they're implemented.</p>
