<p>To finish our discussion of binary heaps, we will look at a method to build an entire heap from a vector of keys. The first method you might think of may be like the following. Given a vector of keys, you could easily build a heap by inserting each key one at a time. Since you are starting with a vector of one item, the vector is sorted and you could use binary search to find the right position to insert the next key at a cost of approximately <span class="process-math">\(O(\log{n})\)</span> operations. However, remember that inserting an item in the middle of the vector may require <span class="process-math">\(O(n)\)</span> operations to shift the rest of the vector over to make room for the new key. Therefore, to insert <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> keys into the heap would require a total of <span class="process-math">\(O(n \log{n})\)</span> operations. However, if we start with an entire vector then we can build the whole heap in <span class="process-math">\(O(n)\)</span> operations. <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/binheap_lst-heap6.html" title="Listing 8.10.10">ListingÂ 8.10.10</a> shows the code to build the entire heap.</p>
