Node "A" is the root, with a balance factor of -2, indicating that its right subtree is significantly taller than its left subtree. Node "C" is the right child of "A," with a balance factor of 1, meaning its left subtree is taller than its right subtree. Node "B" is the left child of "C," with a balance factor of 0, indicating it is balanced. The structure of the tree demonstrates a more complex scenario for balancing due to conflicting balance factors at different levels.'></div>
