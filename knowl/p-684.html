<p>As an alternative to space requirements, we can analyze and compare algorithms based on the amount of time they require to execute. This measure is sometimes referred to as the “execution time” or “running time” of the algorithm. One way we can measure the execution time for the function <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">sumOfN</code> is to do a benchmark analysis. This means that we will track the actual time required for the program to compute its result. In C++, we can benchmark a function by noting the starting time and ending time with respect to the system we are using. In the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">ctime</code> library there is a function called <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">clock</code> that will return the current system clock time in seconds since some arbitrary starting point. By calling this function twice, at the beginning and at the end, and then computing the difference, we can get an exact number of seconds (fractions in most cases) for execution.</p>
