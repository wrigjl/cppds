<p>The question we raised earlier asked whether one function is better than another. The answer depends on your criteria. The function <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">sumOfN</code> is certainly better than the function <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">foo</code> if you are concerned with readability. In fact, you have probably seen many examples of this in your introductory programming course since one of the goals there is to help you write programs that are easy to read and easy to understand. In this course, however, we are also interested in characterizing the algorithm itself. (We certainly hope that you will continue to strive to write readable, understandable code.)</p>
