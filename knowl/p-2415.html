<p>Diagram of a complete binary tree. The top node, or the root, is labeled '5'. This root node has two child nodes: '9' to the left and '11' to the right. Each of these child nodes further branches out into two more nodes. The left child '9' has nodes '14' and '18' as children. '14' has a single left child labeled '33', while '18' has two children labeled '17' and '27'. On the right side, the child '11' has two children labeled '19' and '21'. The tree is balanced and each level is fully filled except for the last level, which is filled from the left. The image is labeled 'Figure 1: A Complete Binary Tree'.</p>
