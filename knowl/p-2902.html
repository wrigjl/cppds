<p>The following sequence of figures (<a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-mst1.html" title="Figure 9.22.2">Figure 9.22.2</a> through <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-mst1.html" title="Figure 9.22.2">Figure 9.22.2</a>) shows the algorithm in operation on our sample tree. We begin with the starting vertex as A. The distances to all the other vertices are initialized to infinity. Looking at the neighbors of A we can update distances to two of the additional vertices B and C because the distances to B and C through A are less than infinite. This moves B and C to the front of the priority queue. Update the predecessor links for B and C by setting them to point to A. It is important to note that we have not formally added B or C to the spanning tree yet. A node is not considered to be part of the spanning tree until it is removed from the priority queue.</p>
