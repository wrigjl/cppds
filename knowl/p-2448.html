<p>Now that you know what a binary search tree is, we will look at how a binary search tree is constructed. The search tree in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/bst_fig-simplebst.html" title="Figure 8.13.1">FigureÂ 8.13.1</a> represents the nodes that exist after we have inserted the following keys in the order shown: <span class="process-math">\(70,31,93,94,14,23,73\text{.}\)</span> Since 70 was the first key inserted into the tree, it is the root. Next, 31 is less than 70, so it becomes the left child of 70. Next, 93 is greater than 70, so it becomes the right child of 70. Now we have two levels of the tree filled, so the next key is going to be the left or right child of either 31 or 93. Since 94 is greater than 70 and 93, it becomes the right child of 93. Similarly 14 is less than 70 and 31, so it becomes the left child of 31. 23 is also less than 31, so it must be in the left subtree of 31. However, it is greater than 14, so it becomes the right child of 14.</p>
