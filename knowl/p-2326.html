<p>We can also represent a mathematical expression such as <span class="process-math">\(((7 + 3) * (5 - 2))\)</span> as a parse tree, as shown in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-meparse.html" title="Figure 8.5.2">Figure 8.5.2</a>. We have already looked at fully parenthesized expressions, so what do we know about this expression? We know that multiplication has a higher precedence than either addition or subtraction. Because of the parentheses, we know that before we can do the multiplication we must evaluate the parenthesized addition and subtraction expressions. The hierarchy of the tree helps us understand the order of evaluation for the whole expression. Before we can evaluate the top-level multiplication, we must evaluate the addition and the subtraction in the subtrees. The addition, which is the left subtree, evaluates to 10. The subtraction, which is the right subtree, evaluates to 3. Using the hierarchical structure of trees, we can simply replace an entire subtree with one node once we have evaluated the expressions in the children. Applying this replacement procedure gives us the simplified tree shown in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-mesimple.html" title="Figure 8.5.3">Figure 8.5.3</a>.</p>
