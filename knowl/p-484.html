<p>This difference is what allows C++ to be as fast as it is, which also makes it particularly good for graphically-intensive applications. Graphical applications heavily leverage memory management to display every pixel you see on your screen. Many languages do not allow for the creation of arrays like in C++, which are just “chunks” of memory of a fixed size. Furthermore, running directly on the hardware allows C++ to communicate better with other components of your computer, such as your graphics processing unit, or “GPU”. This is one of many reasons C++ is considered an industry standard for high-performance graphics applications, such as video games or software used for visual effects in movies.</p>
