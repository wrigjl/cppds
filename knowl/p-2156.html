<p>A series of diagrams illustrating the process of finding the split point for the number 54 in a Quick Sort algorithm. The diagrams show a row of numbers with two markers, 'leftmark' and 'rightmark', that move towards each other from opposite ends. Each step of the process is annotated with instructions like 'leftmark and rightmark will converge on split point', '26 &lt;54 move to right, exchange 20 and 93, and so on. The movement of the markers and the exchanges of numbers are depicted with arrows and highlighted actions, detailing how the algorithm partitions the data around the pivot. The final diagram shows the leftmark and rightmark crossing over, indicating the split point has been found, and the pivot, 54, is in its correct position.</p>
