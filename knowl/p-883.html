<p>Figure 3 summarizes the results of running Listing 6. You can see that the hash table is consistently faster. For the smallest vector size of 10,000 elements a hash table is 89.4 times faster than a vector. For the largest vector size of 990,000 elements the hash table is 11,603 times faster! You can also see that the time it takes for the contains operator on the vector grows linearly with the size of the vector. This verifies the assertion that the contains operator on a vector is . It can also be seen that the time for the contains operator on a hash table is constant even as the hash table size grows. In fact for a hash table size of 10,000 the contains operation took 0.004 milliseconds and for the hash table size of 990,000 it also took 0.004 milliseconds.</p>
