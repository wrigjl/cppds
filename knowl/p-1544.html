<p>The linked list implementation given above is called a singly linked list because each node has a single pointer to the next node in sequence. An alternative implementation is known as a doubly linked list. In this implementation, each node has a pointer to the next node (commonly called next) as well as a pointer to the preceding node (commonly called back). The head pointer also contains two pointers, one to the first node in the linked list and one to the last. Code this implementation in C++.</p>
