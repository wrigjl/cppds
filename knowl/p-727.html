<p>As another example, suppose that for some algorithm, the exact number of steps is <span class="process-math">\(T(n)=5n^{2}+27n+1005\text{.}\)</span> When <em class="emphasis">n</em> is small, say 1 or 2, the constant 1005 seems to be the dominant part of the function. However, as <em class="emphasis">n</em> gets larger, the <span class="process-math">\(n^{2}\)</span> term becomes the most important. In fact, when <em class="emphasis">n</em> is really large, the other two terms become insignificant in the role that they play in determining the final result. Again, to approximate <span class="process-math">\(T(n)\)</span> as <em class="emphasis">n</em> gets large, we can ignore the other terms and focus on <span class="process-math">\(5n^{2}\text{.}\)</span> In addition, the coefficient <span class="process-math">\(5\)</span> becomes insignificant as <em class="emphasis">n</em> gets large. We would say then that the function <span class="process-math">\(T(n)\)</span> has an order of magnitude <span class="process-math">\(f(n)=n^{2}\text{,}\)</span> or simply that it is <span class="process-math">\(O(n^{2})\text{.}\)</span></p>
