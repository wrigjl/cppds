<p>Consider the following situation in a computer science laboratory. On any average day about 10 students are working in the lab at any given hour. These students typically print up to twice during that time, and the length of these tasks ranges from 1 to 20 pages. The printer in the lab is older, capable of processing 10 pages per minute of draft quality. The printer could be switched to give better quality, but then it would produce only five pages per minute. The slower printing speed could make students wait too long. What page rate should be used?</p>
