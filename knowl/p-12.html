<p>This chapter emphasizes two important areas for the rest of the text. First, it reviews the framework within which computer science and the study of algorithms and data structures must fit, in particular, the reasons why we need to study these topics and how understanding these topics helps us to become better problem solvers. Second, we review the C++ programming language. Although we cannot provide a detailed, exhaustive reference, we will give examples and explanations for the basic constructs and ideas that will occur throughout the remaining chapters.</p>
