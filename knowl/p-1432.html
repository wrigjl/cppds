<p>A diagram illustrating the process of adding a new node with the value "26" to a linked list. The list initially starts with a "head" pointer referencing the first node containing "93." This node links to subsequent nodes with values "17," "77," and "31," ending with a vertical line that marks the end of the list. The process involves two steps. In Step 1, the "next" field of the new node ("26") is set to point to the node currently referenced by the "head" (node "93"). In Step 2, the "head" pointer is updated to reference the new node ("26"), effectively inserting it at the beginning of the list. The "temp" variable temporarily holds the new node during this process.</p>
