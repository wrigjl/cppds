<p>Now that we have seen how performance can be measured concretely you can look at <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/algorithm_analysis_algorithm_analysis_tbl_vectbigocpp.html" title="Table 2.6.4: Big-O Efficiency of C++ Vector Operators">Table 2.6.4</a> to see the Big-O efficiency of all the basic vector operations. When <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">pop_back()</code> is called, the element at the end of the vector is removed and it typically takes <span class="process-math">\(O(1)\)</span> but when <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">erase()</code> is called on the first element in the vector or anywhere in the middle it is <span class="process-math">\(O(n)\text{.}\)</span> The reason for this lies in how C++ chooses to implement vectors. When an item is taken from the front of the vector, in C++ implementation, all the other elements in the vector are shifted one position closer to the beginning. This may seem silly to you now, but if you look at <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/algorithm_analysis_algorithm_analysis_tbl_vectbigocpp.html" title="Table 2.6.4: Big-O Efficiency of C++ Vector Operators">Table 2.6.4</a> you will see that this implementation also allows the index operation to be <span class="process-math">\(O(1)\text{.}\)</span> This is a tradeoff that the C++ implementers thought was a good one.</p>
