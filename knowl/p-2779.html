<p>The visualization in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/graphs_knighttour-figvideo.html" title="Figure 9.14.3">FigureÂ 9.14.3</a> depicts the full process of a Knight's Tour solution. It portrays the visitation of every spot on the chess board and an analysis on all neighboring locations, and finishes by showing the final solution wherein all locations on the chess board have been visited. The Warnsdorff heuristic is used in this visualization, so all neighbors with less moves are prioritized over neighbors with more moves. The individual components of the visualization are indicated by color and shape, which is described below.</p>
