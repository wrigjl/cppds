<p>Stamps provide a way to make several copies of the shape of the turtle across the screen without having to trace each shape individually with the turtle. This can be used for a variety of visual effects, however it is often used as a time-saving utility. Stamps can be placed with the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">stamp</code> method of Turtle objects, which returns an integer that acts as the <dfn class="terminology">ID</dfn> of the stamp that has been placed. The <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">clearstamp</code> method of the Turtle object can be used to delete a single stamp from the screen, while the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">clearstamps</code> method is used to delete multiple stamps at once.</p>
