<p>At this point, we will not implement the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">performGateLogic</code> function. The reason for this is that we do not know how each gate will perform its own logic operation. Those details will be included by each individual gate that is added to the hierarchy. This is a very powerful idea in object-oriented programming. We are writing a method that will use code that does not exist yet. The parameter <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">virtual</code> is a reference to the actual gate object invoking the method. Any new logic gate that gets added to the hierarchy will simply need to implement the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">performGateLogic</code> function and it will be used at the appropriate time. Once done, the gate can provide its output value. This ability to extend a hierarchy that currently exists and provide the specific functions that the hierarchy needs to use the new class is extremely important for reusing existing code.</p>
