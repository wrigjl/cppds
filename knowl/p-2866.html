<p>To keep track of the total cost from the start node to each destination we will make use of the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">dist</code> variable in the Vertex class. The <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">dist</code> variable will contain the current total weight of the smallest weight path from the start to the vertex in question. The algorithm iterates once for every vertex in the graph; however, the order that we iterate over the vertices is controlled by a priority queue. The value that is used to determine the order of the objects in the priority queue is <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">dist</code>. When a vertex is first created <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">dist</code> is set to a very large number. Theoretically you would set <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">dist</code> to infinity, but in practice we just set it to a number that is larger than any real distance we would have in the problem we are trying to solve.</p>
