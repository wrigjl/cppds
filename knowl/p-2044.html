<p>There are many, many sorting algorithms that have been developed and analyzed. This suggests that sorting is an important area of study in computer science. Sorting a large number of items can take a substantial amount of computing resources. Like searching, the efficiency of a sorting algorithm is related to the number of items being processed. For small collections, a complex sorting method may be more trouble than it's worth. The overhead may be too high. On the other hand, for larger collections, we want to take advantage of as many improvements as possible. In this section we will discuss several sorting techniques and compare them with respect to their running time.</p>
