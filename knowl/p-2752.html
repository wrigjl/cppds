<p>DFS also uses colors to keep track of which vertices in the graph have been visited. Unvisited vertices are colored white, and visited vertices are colored gray. If all neighbors of a particular vertex have been explored and we have not yet reached our goal length of 64 vertices, we have reached a dead end. When we reach a dead end we must backtrack. Backtracking happens when we return from <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">knightTour</code> with a status of <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">False</code>. In the breadth first search we used a queue to keep track of which vertex to visit next. Since depth first search is recursive, we are implicitly using a stack to help us with our backtracking. When we return from a call to <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">knightTour</code> with a status of <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">False</code>, in line 11, we remain inside the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">while</code> loop and look at the next vertex in <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">nbrList</code>.</p>
