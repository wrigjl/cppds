<p>As we process the expression, the operators have to be saved somewhere since their corresponding right operands have not yet been seen. Additionally, because of their priority, the order of these saved operators might need to be changed, which is the case for the multiplication and addition in this example. Since the addition operator comes before the multiplication operator and has lower precedence, it needs to appear after the multiplication operator is used. Because of this reversal of order, it makes sense to consider using a stack to keep the operators until they are needed.</p>
