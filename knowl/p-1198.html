<p>In addition to printing queues, operating systems use a number of different queues to control processes within a computer. The scheduling of what gets done next is typically based on a queuing algorithm that tries to execute programs as quickly as possible and serve as many users as it can. Also, as we type, sometimes keystrokes get ahead of the characters that appear on the screen. This is due to the computer doing other work at that moment. The keystrokes are being placed in a queue-like buffer so that they can eventually be displayed on the screen in the proper order.</p>
