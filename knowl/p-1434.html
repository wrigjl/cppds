<p>A diagram showing an incorrect process for adding a new node ("26") to a linked list, resulting in the loss of the original head node. The "head" pointer is updated to reference the new node ("26") without first preserving a reference to the original head node ("93"). The original linked list, consisting of nodes "93," "17," "77," and "31," becomes disconnected, with no external reference to it, as indicated by the dashed oval labeled "no external reference." The new node ("26") points to the end of the list, represented by a vertical line, making it the only accessible node in the structure. The "temp" variable temporarily holds the new node during this process.</p>
