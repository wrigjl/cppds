<p>This image illustrates the process of reversing the order of elements in a stack. The stack contains four elements: "8.4", "True", "dog", and "4". The "Original Order" is represented at the bottom of the image, starting with "8.4" (4th element) at the top of the stack and ending with "4" (1st element) at the bottom. The "Reversed Order" is shown on the right side, where the elements have been rearranged such that "4" becomes the first element, "dog" the second, "True" the third, and "8.4" the fourth. The arrows illustrate the flow of elements from their positions in the stack to their corresponding reversed positions, emphasizing how a stack's Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) nature can be used to reverse a sequence of elements.</p>
