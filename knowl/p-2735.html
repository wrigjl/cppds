<p>Of course doing the breadth first search is only part of the task. Following the links from the starting node to the goal node is the other part of the task. The worst case for this would be if the graph was a single long chain. In this case traversing through all of the vertices would be <span class="process-math">\(O(V)\text{.}\)</span> The normal case is going to be some fraction of <span class="process-math">\(|V|\)</span> but we would still write <span class="process-math">\(O(V)\text{.}\)</span></p>
