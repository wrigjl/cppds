<p>Image showing the final breadth-first search tree. The root of the tree is the word 'fool' with four branches leading to the words 'pool', 'foil', 'foul', and 'cool', each marked with a '1' indicating the first level of connections. 'Pool' connects to 'poll' (level 2), which further connects to 'pole' (level 3), leading to 'pope' (level 4), then to 'page' (level 5), and finally to 'sage' (level 6). Similarly, 'foil' connects to 'fail' (level 2), and 'poll' also connects to 'pall' (level 3), leading to 'pale' (level 4) and 'sale' (level 5). The levels indicate the number of steps taken from the root word to reach each subsequent word by changing one letter at a time. An empty queue box is shown to the side, suggesting that the search has been completed.</p>
