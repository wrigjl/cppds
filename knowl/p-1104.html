<p>The function <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">divideBy2</code> can be modified to accept not only a decimal value but also a base for the intended conversion. The “Divide by 2” idea is simply replaced with a more general “Divide by base.” A new function called <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">baseConverter</code>, shown in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/lst-baseconverter-cpp.html" title="Task 3.8.2.a: C++ Implementation">Task 3.8.2.a</a>, takes a decimal number and any base between 2 and 16 as parameters. The remainders are still pushed onto the stack until the value being converted becomes 0. The same left-to-right string construction technique can be used with one slight change. Base 2 through base 10 numbers require a maximum of 10 digits, so the typical digit characters 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 work fine. The problem comes when we go beyond base 10. We can no longer simply use these remainders as digits, because they are themselves represented as two-digit decimal numbers. Instead we need to create a set of digits that can be used to represent those remainders beyond 9.</p>
