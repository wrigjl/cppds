<p>One of the fundamental building blocks of a computer is something called a flip flop.  It's not something that computer science professors wear on their feet, but rather a kind of circuit that is stable and stores the last piece of data that was put on it.  A simple flip-flop can be made from two <dfn class="terminology">NOR</dfn> gates (a combination <dfn class="terminology">OR</dfn> and <dfn class="terminology">NOT</dfn>) that are tied together as in the following diagram. Create a new gate class, called NorGate. NorGates work like OrGates that have a Not attached to the output. See if you can use your new class to implement this.</p>
<div class="image-box" style="width: 50%; margin-left: 25%; margin-right: 25%;"><img src="external/Introduction/flipflop.png" class="contained" alt='Image showing a simple flip-flop circuit constructed with two NOR gates. The circuit consists of two inputs labeled "Reset" and "Set," which feed into the respective NOR gates. The output of the upper NOR gate loops back as an input to the lower NOR gate, while the output of the lower NOR gate loops back as an input to the upper NOR gate. This feedback loop creates a stable circuit that can store a single bit of data based on the states of the "Reset" and "Set" inputs.'></div>
<p>Note if the initial inputs to Reset and Set are both 0 then the output of the flip-flop is 0.  But if the Set input is toggled to 1 then the output becomes 1.  The great thing is that when the set input goes to 0 the output stays 1, until the reset input is toggled to 1 which resets the output of the circuit back to zero.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="introduction_inheritance-in-c.html#note-3" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
