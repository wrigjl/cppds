<p><a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/binheap_fig-buildheap.html" title="Figure 8.10.11">Figure 8.10.11</a> shows the swaps that the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">buildHeap</code> method makes as it moves the nodes in an initial tree of [9, 6, 5, 2, 3] into their proper positions. Although we start out in the middle of the tree and work our way back toward the root, the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">percDown</code> method ensures that the largest child is always moved down the tree. Because the heap is a complete binary tree, any nodes past the halfway point will be leaves and therefore have no children. Notice that when <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">i=1</code>, we are percolating down from the root of the tree, so this may require multiple swaps. As you can see in the rightmost two trees of <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/binheap_fig-buildheap.html" title="Figure 8.10.11">Figure 8.10.11</a>, first the 9 is moved out of the root position, but after 9 is moved down one level in the tree, <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">percDown</code> ensures that we check the next set of children farther down in the tree to ensure that it is pushed as low as it can go. In this case it results in a second swap with 3. Now that 9 has been moved to the lowest level of the tree, no further swapping can be done. It is useful to compare the vector representation of this series of swaps as shown in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/binheap_fig-buildheap.html" title="Figure 8.10.11">Figure 8.10.11</a> with the tree representation.</p>
