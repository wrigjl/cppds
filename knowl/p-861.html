<p>As a way of demonstrating the difference in performance between <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">push_back</code> and <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">insert</code>, let's do another experiment using the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">ctime</code> module. Our goal is to be able to verify the performance of the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">pop_back()</code> operation on a vector of a known size when the program pops from the end of the vector using <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">pop_back()</code>, and again when the program pops from the beginning of the vector using <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">erase()</code>. We will also want to measure this time for vectors of different sizes. What we would expect to see is that the time required to pop from the end of the vector will stay constant even as the vector grows in size, while the time to pop from the beginning of the vector will continue to increase as the vector grows.</p>
