<p>Before we begin with the implementation of Binary Heaps, let us review a real life example of one of the things: Priority Queues. Let us consider a priority queue of homework. If we were trying to decide which homework project to complete, it would make sense to organize the order of doing any specific project based on the deadline of that homework. Let us say you were assigned homeworks in the following order and you are told the deadlines for those homeworks: 3, 10, 5, 8, 7, 2 days respectively. You can observe the insertion of these homeworks into our priority queue in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-trees_pq-insertion.html" title="Figure 8.8.1">FigureÂ 8.8.1</a>.</p>
