<p>Image illustrating the concept of a dangling pointer reference in C++ due to incorrect pointer assignment. The diagram shows a pointer variable "ptrN" pointing to memory address 100. However, the value at this memory address is undefined or unknown (represented by a "?" in the memory box). At the same time, the variable "varN" correctly stores the value 100 in its allocated memory. This mismatch occurs because the pointer "ptrN" was assigned the value of "varN" directly, without using the address-of operator (&amp;). As a result, "ptrN" does not point to the actual memory location of "varN" but instead refers to an unintended location, which may lead to undefined behavior.</p>
