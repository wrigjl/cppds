<p>We will begin our study of data structures by considering four simple but very powerful concepts. Vectors, stacks, queues, deques are examples of data collections whose items are ordered depending on how they are added or removed. Once an item is added, it stays in that position relative to the other elements that came before and came after it. Collections such as these are often referred to as <dfn class="terminology">linear data structures</dfn>.</p>
