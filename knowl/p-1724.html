<p>You will notice that in the recursive step, there are four recursive calls to <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">searchFrom</code>. It is hard to predict how many of these recursive calls will be used since they are all connected by “or” operators. If the first call to <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">searchFrom</code> returns <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">true</code> then none of the last three calls would be needed. You can interpret this as meaning that a step to <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">(row-1,column)</code> (or North if you want to think geographically) is on the path leading out of the maze. If there is not a good path leading out of the maze to the North then the next recursive call is tried, this one to the South. If South fails then try West, and finally East. If all four recursive calls return false then we have found a dead end. You should download or type in the whole program and experiment with it by changing the order of these calls.</p>
