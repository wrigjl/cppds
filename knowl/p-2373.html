<p>Let's look at some examples that illustrate each of these three kinds of traversals. First let's look at the preorder traversal. As an example of a tree to traverse, we will represent this book as a tree. The book is the root of the tree, and each chapter is a child of the root. Each section within a chapter is a child of the chapter, and each subsection is a child of its section, and so on. <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-booktree.html" title="Figure 8.6.5">FigureÂ 8.6.5</a> shows a limited version of a book with only two chapters. Note that the traversal algorithm works for trees with any number of children, but we will stick with binary trees for now.</p>
