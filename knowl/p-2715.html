<p>Given a graph <span class="process-math">\(G\)</span> and a starting vertex <span class="process-math">\(s\text{,}\)</span> a breadth first search proceeds by exploring edges in the graph to find all the vertices in <span class="process-math">\(G\)</span> for which there is a path from <span class="process-math">\(s\text{.}\)</span> The remarkable thing about a breadth first search is that it finds <em class="emphasis">all</em> the vertices that are a distance <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> from <span class="process-math">\(s\)</span> before it finds <em class="emphasis">any</em> vertices that are a distance <span class="process-math">\(k+1\text{.}\)</span> One good way to visualize what the breadth first search algorithm does is to imagine that it is building a tree, one level of the tree at a time. A breadth first search adds all children of the starting vertex before it begins to discover any of the grandchildren.</p>
