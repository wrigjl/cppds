<p>Search engines like Google and Bing exploit the fact that the pages on the web form a very large directed graph. To transform the World Wide Web into a graph, we will treat a page as a vertex, and the hyperlinks on the page as edges connecting one vertex to another. <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-cshome.html" title="Figure 9.18.1">FigureÂ 9.18.1</a> shows a very small part of the graph produced by following the links from one page to the next, beginning at Luther College's Computer Science home page. Of course, this graph could be huge, so we have limited it to web sites that are no more than 10 links away from the CS home page.</p>
