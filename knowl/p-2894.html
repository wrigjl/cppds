<p> A brute force solution is for the broadcast host to send a single copy of the broadcast message and let the routers sort things out. In this case, the easiest solution is a strategy called <dfn class="terminology">uncontrolled flooding</dfn>. The flooding strategy works as follows. Each message starts with a time to live (<code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">ttl</code>) value set to some number greater than or equal to the number of edges between the broadcast host and its most distant listener. Each router gets a copy of the message and passes the message on to <em class="emphasis">all</em> of its neighboring routers. When the message is passed on the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">ttl</code> is decreased. Each router continues to send copies of the message to all its neighbors until the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">ttl</code> value reaches 0. It is easy to convince yourself that uncontrolled flooding generates many more unnecessary messages than our first strategy.</p>
