<p>Image depicting the legal moves for a knight on a chessboard and the corresponding graph. On the left, there is a 5x5 section of a chessboard with numbered squares from 1 to 25. The knight is placed on square 12, with its legal moves indicated by gray dots on squares 5, 9, 15, 19, 21, and 23. On the right, a graph illustrates the knight's moves as a network of connected nodes. The central node, labeled '12', represents the knight's position, and it is connected to nodes labeled '5', '9', '15', '19', '21', and '23', which correspond to the potential moves available to the knight from its current position.</p>
