<p>Now that we have studied linear data structures like stacks and queues and have some experience with recursion, we will look at a common data structure called the <dfn class="terminology">tree</dfn>. Trees are used in many areas of computer science, including operating systems, graphics, database systems, and computer networking. Tree data structures have many things in common with their botanical cousins. A tree data structure has a root, branches, and leaves. The difference between a tree in nature and a tree in computer science is that a tree data structure has its root at the top and its leaves on the bottom.</p>
