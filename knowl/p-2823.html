<p>To demonstrate that computer scientists can turn just about anything into a graph problem, let's consider the difficult problem of stirring up a batch of pancakes. The recipe is really quite simple: 1 egg, 1 cup of pancake mix, 1 tablespoon oil, and <span class="process-math">\(3 \over 4\)</span> cup of milk. To make pancakes you must heat the griddle, mix all the ingredients together and spoon the mix onto a hot griddle. When the pancakes start to bubble you turn them over and let them cook until they are golden brown on the bottom. Before you eat your pancakes you are going to want to heat up some syrup. <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-pancakes.html" title="Figure 9.17.1">FigureÂ 9.17.1</a> illustrates this process as a graph.</p>
