<p>A bubble sort is often considered the most inefficient sorting method since it must exchange items before the final location is known. These “wasted” exchange operations are very costly. However, because the bubble sort makes passes through the entire unsorted portion of the array, it has the capability to do something most sorting algorithms cannot. In particular, if during a pass there are no exchanges, then we know that the array must be sorted. A bubble sort can be modified to stop early if it finds that the array has become sorted. This means that for arrays that require just a few passes, a bubble sort may have an advantage in that it will recognize the sorted array and stop. <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/lst-shortbubbles-cpp.html" title="Task 7.3.2.a: C++ Implementation">Task 7.3.2.a</a> shows this modification, which is often referred to as the <dfn class="terminology">short bubble</dfn>.</p>
