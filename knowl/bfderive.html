The diagram consists of two stages: the initial tree structure and the resulting tree after the rotation. In the initial tree, node "B" is the root, with node "A" as its left child and node "D" as its right child. Node "D" has two subtrees, "C" as its left child and "E" as its right child. After the left rotation, node "D" becomes the new root, with node "B" as its left child and node "E" as its right child. Node "B" retains "A" as its left child and "C" as its right child. The arrow between the two stages indicates the direction of the rotation. This figure demonstrates the rebalancing operation in a binary tree by performing a left rotation.'></div>
