<p>You can see many similarities to C++ code already used for stacks and queues. In the STL, the deque gives <span class="process-math">\(O(1)\)</span> performance for adding and removing items from both the front and back of the queue. In the Python implementation in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/lst-dequecode-py.html" title="Task 3.17.1.b: Python Implementation">TaskÂ 3.17.1.b</a>, adding and removing items from the back is <span class="process-math">\(O(1)\)</span> whereas adding and removing from the front is <span class="process-math">\(O(n)\text{.}\)</span> This is to be expected given the common operations that appear for adding and removing items to lists. Again, the important thing is to be certain that we know where the front and rear are assigned in the implementation.</p>
