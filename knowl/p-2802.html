<p>The search begins at vertex A of the graph (<a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-gdfsa.html" title="Figure 9.15.1">FigureÂ 9.15.1</a>). Since all of the vertices are white at the beginning of the search the algorithm visits vertex A. The first step in visiting a vertex is to set the color to gray, which indicates that the vertex is being explored and the discovery time is set to 1. Since vertex A has two adjacent vertices (B, D) each of those need to be visited as well. We'll make the arbitrary decision that we will visit the adjacent vertices in alphabetical order.</p>
