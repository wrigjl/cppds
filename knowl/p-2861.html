<p><a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-inet.html" title="Figure 9.19.1">Figure 9.19.1</a> shows you a high-level overview of how communication on the Internet works. When you use your browser to request a web page from a server, the request must travel over your local area network and out onto the Internet through a router. The request travels over the Internet and eventually arrives at a router for the local area network where the server is located. The web page you requested then travels back through the same routers to get to your browser. Inside the cloud labelled “Internet” in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-inet.html" title="Figure 9.19.1">Figure 9.19.1</a> are additional routers. The job of all of these routers is to work together to get your information from place to place. You can see there are many routers for yourself if your computer supports the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">traceroute</code> command. The text below shows the output of the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">traceroute</code> command which illustrates that there are 13 routers between the web server at Luther College and the mail server at the University of Minnesota.</p>
