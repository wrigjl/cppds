<p>We could decide by building a simulation that models the laboratory. We will need to construct representations for students, printing tasks, and the printer (<a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-qulabsim.html" title="Figure 3.14.1">FigureÂ 3.14.1</a>). As students submit printing tasks, we will add them to a waiting list, a queue of print tasks attached to the printer. When the printer completes a task, it will look at the queue to see if there are any remaining tasks to process. Of interest for us is the average amount of time students will wait for their papers to be printed. This is equal to the average amount of time a task waits in the queue.</p>
