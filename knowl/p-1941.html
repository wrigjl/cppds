<p>Image of a hash table with eleven slots numbered from 0 to 10, demonstrating collision resolution with chaining. Each slot is either empty, labeled 'None', or contains a vertical list of numbers, representing a chain of items that have been hashed to the same slot. Slot 0 has a chain of '77', followed by '44' and '55'. Slot 4 has '26' and '93', slot 6 has '17', slot 9 has '31' and '54', and slot 10 has '20'. The chains are represented by numbers in boxes with arrows pointing downwards to the next number in the chain, depicting how collisions are resolved by linking items within the same slot.</p>
