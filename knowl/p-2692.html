<p>The adjacency matrix is a good implementation for a graph when the number of edges is large. But what do we mean by large? How many edges would be needed to fill the matrix? Since there is one row and one column for every vertex in the graph, the number of edges required to fill the matrix is <span class="process-math">\(|V|^2\text{.}\)</span> A matrix is full when every vertex is connected to every other vertex. There are few real problems that approach this sort of connectivity. The problems we will look at in this chapter all involve graphs that are sparsely connected.</p>
