<p>The second case is only slightly more complicated (see <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/bst_lst-bst7.html" title="Listing 8.13.11">ListingÂ 8.13.11</a>). If a node has only a single child, then we can simply promote the child to take the place of its parent. The code for this case is shown in the next listing.
