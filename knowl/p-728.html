<p>Although we do not see this in the summation example, sometimes the performance of an algorithm depends on the exact values of the data rather than simply the size of the problem. For these kinds of algorithms we need to characterize their performance in terms of <dfn class="terminology">best case</dfn>, <dfn class="terminology">worst case</dfn>, or <dfn class="terminology">average case</dfn> performance. The worst-case performance refers to a particular data set where the algorithm performs extremely poorly. At the same time, a different data set for the exact same algorithm might have outstanding performance. However, in most cases the algorithm performs somewhere in between these two extremes (average case). It is important for a computer scientist to understand these distinctions so they are not misled by one particular case.</p>
