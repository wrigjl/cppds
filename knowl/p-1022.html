<p>One of the most useful ideas related to stacks comes from the simple observation of items as they are added and then removed. Assume you start out with a clean desktop. Now place books one at a time on top of each other. You are constructing a stack. Consider what happens when you begin removing books. The order that they are removed is exactly the reverse of the order that they were placed. Stacks are fundamentally important, as they can be used to reverse the order of items. The order of insertion is the reverse of the order of removal. <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/linear-basic-stack-fig-reversal.html" title="Figure 3.3.3">FigureÂ 3.3.3</a> shows the stack object as it was created and then again as items are removed. Note the order of the objects.</p>
