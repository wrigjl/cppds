<p>The conventional tool used for these kinds of illustrations is Python's turtle graphics module called <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">turtle</code>. The <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">turtle</code> module is standard with all versions of Python and is very easy to use. The metaphor is quite simple. You can create a turtle and the turtle can move forward, backward, turn left, turn right, etc. The turtle can have its tail up or down. When the turtle's tail is down and the turtle moves it draws a line as it moves. To increase the artistic value of the turtle you can change the width of the tail as well as the color of the ink the tail is dipped in.</p>
