<p>Image showing the second step in a breadth-first search algorithm on a word graph. The central node is labeled 'fool', with connections to four adjacent nodes: 'pool', 'foil', 'foul', and 'cool', each marked with a '1' indicating they were reached in the first step of the search. 'Pool' is further connected to a node labeled 'poll', marked with a '2' indicating it is reached in the second step. Below the graph, a queue is shown containing 'foil', 'foul', 'cool', and 'poll', reflecting the order in which they are visited. This demonstrates the process of exploring each node's neighbors and tracking the search progression through levels or layers.</p>
