<p>However, unlike basic arrays, vectors have a <dfn class="terminology">dynamic size</dfn> meaning that whenever a new element is inserted or deleted, their size changes automatically. A new element can be inserted into or deleted from any part of a vector, and automatic reallocation for other existing items in the vector is applied. Nevertheless, computing time for insertion and deletion might differ depending on the location of the item, and how many items need to be reallocated. For example, the last item in a vector is typically removed at a constant time, because no resizing of the vector is typically needed for this operation, while an item is removed or inserted into the beginning or the middle of a vector at a linear time because all of the remaining items to the right of that element must be shifted.</p>
