<ol class="decimal">
<li><p>Implement the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">Queue</code> ADT, using a list such that the rear of the queue is at the end of the list.</p></li>
<li><p>Design and implement an experiment to do benchmark comparisons of the two queue implementations. What can you learn from such an experiment?</p></li>
<li><p>It is possible to implement a queue using a linked list such that both enqueue and dequeue have <span class="process-math">\(O(1)\)</span> performance <em class="emphasis">on average</em>. In this case it means that most of the time enqueue and dequeue will be <span class="process-math">\(O(1)\)</span> except in one particular circumstance where dequeue will be <span class="process-math">\(O(n)\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>To implement the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">length</code> method, we counted the number of nodes in the list. An alternative strategy would be to store the number of nodes in the list as an additional piece of data in the head of the list. Modify the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">UnorderedList</code> class to include this information and rewrite the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">length</code> method.</p></li>
<li><p>Implement the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">remove</code> method so that it works correctly in the case where the item is not in the list.</p></li>
<li><p>Modify the list classes to allow duplicates. Which methods will be impacted by this change?</p></li>
<li><p>Overload the cout operator in the UnorderedList class. What would be a good printed representation for a list?</p></li>
<li><p>Overload the cout operator so that lists are displayed the with square brackets.</p></li>
<li><p>Implement the remaining operations defined in the UnorderedList ADT (append, index, pop, insert).</p></li>
<li><p>Implement a slice method for the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">UnorderedList</code> class. It should take two parameters, <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">start</code> and <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">stop</code>, and return a copy of the list starting at the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">start</code> position and going up to but not including the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">stop</code> position.</p></li>
<li><p>Implement the remaining operations defined in the OrderedList ADT.</p></li>
<li><p>Consider the relationship between Unordered and Ordered lists. Is it possible that inheritance could be used to build a more efficient implementation? Implement this inheritance hierarchy.</p></li>
<li><p>Implement a stack using linked lists.</p></li>
<li><p>Implement a queue using linked lists.</p></li>
<li><p>Implement a deque using linked lists.</p></li>
<li><p>Design and implement an experiment that will compare the performance of a C++ vector with a list implemented as a linked list.</p></li>
<li><p>Design and implement an experiment that will compare the performance of the C++ vector based stack and queue with the linked list implementation.</p></li>
<li><p>The linked list implementation given above is called a singly linked list because each node has a single pointer to the next node in sequence. An alternative implementation is known as a doubly linked list. In this implementation, each node has a pointer to the next node (commonly called next) as well as a pointer to the preceding node (commonly called back). The head pointer also contains two pointers, one to the first node in the linked list and one to the last. Code this implementation in C++.</p></li>
