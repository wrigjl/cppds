<p>For example, <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-stopearly.html" title="Figure 4.6.4">FigureÂ 4.6.4</a> shows the ordered linked list as a search is looking for the value 45. As we traverse, starting at the head of the linked list, we first compare against 17. Since 17 is not the item we are looking for, we move to the next node, in this case 26. Again, this is not what we want, so we move on to 31 and then on to 54. Now, at this point, something is different. Since 54 is not the item we are looking for, our former strategy would be to move forward. However, due to the fact that this is an ordered linked list, that will not be necessary. Once the value in the node becomes greater than the item we are searching for, the search can stop and return <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">False</code>. There is no way the item could exist further out in the linked list.</p>
