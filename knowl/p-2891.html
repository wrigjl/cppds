<p>The image illustrates a network graph representing the Broadcast Problem. It features seven nodes labeled A through G, with node A designated as the broadcast host. Directed edges connect the nodes, indicating the flow of the broadcast signal, with weights on the edges representing the cost or time of transmission. Four of the nodes are marked as listeners, depicted with computer icons. These listeners are at the terminus of the broadcast paths, showing the direction and flow of information from the host to the listeners through the network.</p>
