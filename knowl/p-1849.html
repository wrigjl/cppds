<p>Assume that the list of items was constructed so that the items were in ascending order, from low to high. If the item we are looking for is present in the list, the chance of it being in any one of the <em class="emphasis">n</em> positions is still the same as before. We will still have the same number of comparisons to find the item. However, if the item is not present there is a slight advantage. <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-seqsearch2.html" title="Figure 6.3.5">Figure 6.3.5</a> shows this process as the algorithm looks for the item 50. Notice that items are still compared in sequence until 54. At this point, however, we know something extra. Not only is 54 not the item we are looking for, but no other elements beyond 54 can work either since the list is sorted. In this case, the algorithm does not have to continue looking through all of the items to report that the item was not found. It can stop immediately. <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/lst-orderedseq.html" title="Listing 6.3.6">Listing 6.3.6</a> shows this variation of the sequential search function.</p>
