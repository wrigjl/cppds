<p>The simplest example of a queue is the typical line that we all participate in from time to time. We wait in a line for a movie, we wait in the check-out line at a grocery store, and we wait in the cafeteria line (so that we can pop the tray stack). Well-behaved lines, or queues, are very restrictive in that they have only one way in and only one way out. There is no jumping in the middle and no leaving before you have waited the necessary amount of time to get to the front. <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-qubasicqueue1.html" title="Figure 3.10.1">FigureÂ 3.10.1</a> shows a simple queue of Python data objects.</p>
