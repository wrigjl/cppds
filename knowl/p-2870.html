<p>In the next iteration of the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">while</code> loop we examine the vertices that are adjacent to <span class="process-math">\(x\text{.}\)</span> The vertex <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> is next because it has the lowest overall cost and therefore bubbled its way to the beginning of the priority queue. At <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> we look at its neighbors <span class="process-math">\(u,v,w\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y\text{.}\)</span> For each neighboring vertex we check to see if the distance to that vertex through <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> is smaller than the previously known distance. Obviously this is the case for <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> since its distance was <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">sys.maxint</code>. It is not the case for <span class="process-math">\(u\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(v\)</span> since their distances are 0 and 2 respectively. However, we now learn that the distance to <span class="process-math">\(w\)</span> is smaller if we go through <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> than from <span class="process-math">\(u\)</span> directly to <span class="process-math">\(w\text{.}\)</span> Since that is the case we update <span class="process-math">\(w\)</span> with a new distance and change the predecessor for <span class="process-math">\(w\)</span> from <span class="process-math">\(u\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(x\text{.}\)</span> See <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-dijb.html" title="Figure 9.20.3">FigureÂ 9.20.3</a> for the state of all the vertices.</p>
