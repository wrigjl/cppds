<p>Note that in this example the value of the counting constant is greater than the number of names in the array. This is not a problem since the queue acts like a circle and counting continues back at the beginning until the value is reached. Also, notice that the array is loaded into the queue such that the first name on the array will be at the front of the queue. <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">Bill</code> in this case is the first item in the array and therefore moves to the front of the queue. A variation of this implementation, described in the exercises, allows for a random counter.</p>
