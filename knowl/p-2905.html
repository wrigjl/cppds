<p>This image illustrates the process of Prim's algorithm applied to a graph. The graph has seven circular nodes labeled A through G, connected by lines with numbers indicating the weight of the edges. The algorithm starts at node A and progressively selects the edge with the lowest weight that connects a node inside the tree to a node outside the tree. As a result, the nodes are incrementally connected in a way that keeps the total weight of the tree at a minimum. The letters B, C, D, E, F, and G at the bottom signify the order in which the nodes are added to the growing tree.</p>
