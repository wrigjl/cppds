<p>But what does this benchmark really tell us? Intuitively, we can see that the iterative solutions seem to be doing more work since some program steps are being repeated. This is likely the reason it is taking longer. Also, the time required for the iterative solution seems to increase as we increase the value of <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">n</code>. However, there is a problem. If we run the same function on a different computer or used a different programming language, we would likely get different results. It could take even longer to perform <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">sumOfN3</code> if the computer were older.</p>
