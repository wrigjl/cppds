<p>For our last performance experiment we will compare the performance of the contains operation between vectors and hash tables. In the process we will confirm that the contains operator for vectors is <span class="process-math">\(O(n)\)</span> and the contains operator for hash tables is <span class="process-math">\(O(1)\text{.}\)</span> The experiment we will use to compare the two is simple. We'll make a vector with a range of numbers in it. Then we will pick numbers at random and check to see if the numbers are in the vector. If our performance tables are correct the bigger the vector the longer it should take to determine if any one number is contained in the vector.</p>
