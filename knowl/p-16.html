<p>Computer science can be thought of as the study of algorithms. Some problems do not have solutions at all. Other problems do have solutions, but these solutions cannot be executed in a reasonable amount of time. Although proving these statements is beyond the scope of this text, the fact that some problems cannot be solved and/or cannot be solved in the amount of time available is important for those who study computer science. We can fully define computer science, then, by including these types of problems and stating that computer science is the study of solutions to problems as well as the study of problems without fast solutions and including the study of problems without any solutions at all.</p>
