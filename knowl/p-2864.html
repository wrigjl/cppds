<p><a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-network.html" title="Figure 9.19.2">FigureÂ 9.19.2</a> shows a small example of a weighted graph that represents the interconnection of routers in the Internet. The problem that we want to solve is to find the path with the smallest total weight along which to route any given message. This problem should sound familiar because it is similar to the problem we solved using a breadth first search, except that here we are concerned with the total weight of the path rather than the number of hops in the path. It should be noted that if all the weights are equal, the problem is the same.</p>
