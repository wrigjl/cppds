<p>The base of the stack is significant since items stored in the stack that are closer to the base represent those that have been in the stack the longest. The most recently added item is the one that is in position to be removed first. This ordering principle is sometimes called  <dfn class="terminology">LIFO</dfn>, <dfn class="terminology">last-in first-out</dfn>. It provides an ordering based on length of time in the collection. Newer items are near the top, while older items are near the base.</p>
