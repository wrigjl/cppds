<p>A prefix expression, also known as Polish notation, is a mathematical notation in which every operator follows all of its operands. The primary advantage of prefix notation is that it completely eliminates the need for parentheses to indicate orders of operations. The order in which operations are to be performed is evident from the position of the operators and operands. Example: For the infix expression (a + b) * c, the corresponding prefix notation is * + a b c.</p>
