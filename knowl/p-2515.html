<p>Now that you understand that the performance of the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">put</code> method is limited by the height of the tree, you can probably guess that other methods, <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">get, in,</code> and <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">del</code>, are limited as well. Since <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">get</code> searches the tree to find the key, in the worst case the tree is searched all the way to the bottom and no key is found. At first glance <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">del</code> might seem more complicated, since it may need to search for the successor before the deletion operation can complete. But remember that the worst-case scenario to find the successor is also just the height of the tree which means that you would simply double the work. Since doubling is a constant factor it does not change worst case</p>
