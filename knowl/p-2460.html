<p>A binary search tree (BST) illustrating the process of inserting a new node with the key "19." The tree has "17" as the root node. The left subtree of "17" contains nodes "5" with left child "2" and right child "16". The right subtree of "17" contains nodes "35" with a left child "29" and a right child labeled "38." Node "29" has two children: "33" as its right child and a newly inserted node "19" as its left child. Lightly shaded nodes ("17," "29," and "19") indicate the nodes visited during the insertion process. The newly added node "19" is depicted as darkly shaded to highlight it as the most recently added node.</p>
