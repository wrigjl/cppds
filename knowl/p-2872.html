<p>The image illustrates the initial state of Dijkstra's Algorithm being traced on a weighted graph. The graph includes six nodes: u, v, w, x, y, and z. Node u is marked as the starting point with a tentative distance of zero (d=0), while other nodes are yet to be visited and have undefined distances. Edges connecting the nodes have varying weights, such as the edge from u to x has a weight of 2, and the edge from x to v has a weight of 1. A priority queue (PQ) is depicted at the bottom, currently holding nodes x, v, and w, which will be processed according to the algorithm.</p>
