<p>In order to make our heap work efficiently, we will take advantage of the logarithmic nature of the binary tree to represent our heap. In order to guarantee logarithmic performance, we must keep our tree balanced. A balanced binary tree has roughly the same number of nodes in the left and right subtrees of the root. In our heap implementation we keep the tree balanced by creating a <dfn class="terminology">complete binary tree</dfn>. A complete binary tree is a tree in which each level has all of its nodes. The exception to this is the bottom level of the tree, which we fill in from left to right. <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/binheap_fig-comptree.html" title="Figure 8.10.1">FigureÂ 8.10.1</a> shows an example of a complete binary tree.</p>
