<p>Although the algorithm in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/lst-change2-cpp.html" title="Task 5.12.2.a: C++ Implementation">Task 5.12.2.a</a> is correct, it looks and feels like a bit of a hack.  Also, if we look at the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">knownResults</code> lists we can see that there are some holes in the table. In fact the term for what we have done is not dynamic programming but rather we have improved the performance of our program by using a technique known as “memoization,” or more commonly called “caching.” Memoization uses what is sometimes called an opportunistic top-down approach. When you need the result of a computation, you check to see if you have already computed it, otherwise you do the new calculation and store the result.</p>
