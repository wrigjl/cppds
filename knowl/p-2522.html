<p>A diagram of an unbalanced binary search tree, showing nodes with their corresponding balance factors. The tree structure begins at the root node with a balance factor of "-2," indicating that the tree is right-heavy. The left child of the root has a balance factor of "0," while the right child has a balance factor of "-1." The right child further branches into two nodes: one with a balance factor of "0" and another with "-1." At the far right, the last node in the tree has a balance factor of "0." The diagram visually illustrates the imbalance in the tree caused by the concentration of nodes in the right subtree.</p>
