<p>There are some brute force solutions to this problem, so let's look at them first to help understand the broadcast problem better. This will also help you appreciate the solution that we will propose when we are done. To begin, the broadcast host has some information that the listeners all need to receive. The simplest solution is for the broadcasting host to keep a list of all of the listeners and send individual messages to each. In <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-bcast1.html" title="Figure 9.22.1">FigureÂ 9.22.1</a> we show a small network with a broadcaster and some listeners. Using this first approach, four copies of every message would be sent. Assuming that the least cost path is used, let's see how many times each router would handle the same message.</p>
