        <title>The Merge Sort</title>
        <p><idx>merge sort</idx>We now turn our attention to using a divide and conquer strategy as a
            way to improve the performance of sorting algorithms. The first
            algorithm we will study is the <term>merge sort</term>. Merge sort is a recursive
            algorithm that continually splits a vector in half. If the vector is empty
            or has one item, it is sorted by definition (the base case). If the vector
            has more than one item, we split the vector and recursively invoke a merge
            sort on both halves. Once the two halves are sorted, the fundamental
            operation, called a <term>merge</term>, is performed. Merging is the process of
            taking two smaller sorted vectors and combining them together into a
            single, sorted, new vector. <xref ref="fig-mergesorta"/> shows our familiar example
            vector as it is being split by <c>mergeSort</c>. <xref ref="fig-mergesortb"/> shows
            the simple vectors, now sorted, as they are merged back together.</p>

The chart starts with a single row of numbers at the top: 54, 26, 93, 17, 77, 31, 44, 55, 20, and branches downwards into increasingly smaller groups. Each branch represents a division of the list into two parts, progressively breaking down the numbers into individual elements. The flowchart visually demonstrates how Merge Sort recursively divides a list until each part contains a single element, preparing for the merge phase.</p></description>

                <description><p>A diagram depicting the merging phase of the Merge Sort algorithm. The flowchart shows the combination of divided vectors into a sorted sequence. It starts with smaller groups of numbers at the top, each sorted individually: 26 and 54, 17 and 93, and so on. These groups are then merged into larger sorted sequences through a series of downward-pointing arrows, indicating the order of merging. The process continues until all numbers are combined into a single sorted list at the bottom: 17, 20, 26, 31, 44, 54, 55, 77, 93.</p></description>

        <p>The <c>mergeSort</c> function shown in <xref ref="lst-mergesort-cpp"/> begins by asking the
            base case question. If the length of the vector is less than or equal to
            one, then we already have a sorted vector and no more processing is
            necessary. If, on the other hand, the length is greater than one, then we utilize
            the vector intializer using .begin to extract the left and right halves.
            This is similar to using the Python <c>slice</c> operation to extract the left and right
            halves. It is important to note that the vector may not have an even
            number of items. That does not matter, as the lengths will differ by at
            most one.</p>

        <p>Once the <c>mergeSort</c> function is invoked on the left half and the
            right half (lines 8<ndash/>9), it is assumed they are sorted. The rest of the
            function (lines<nbsp/>11<ndash/>31) is responsible for merging the two smaller sorted
            vectors into a larger sorted vector. Notice that the merge operation places
            the items back into the original vector (<c>avector</c>) one at a time by
            repeatedly taking the smallest item from the sorted vectors.</p>
        <p>The <c>mergeSort</c> function has been augmented with a <c>print</c> statement
            (line 2) to show the contents of the vector being sorted at the start of
            each invocation. There is also a <c>print</c> statement (line 32) to show
            the merging process. The transcript shows the result of executing the
            function on our example vector. Note that the vector with 44, 55, and 20
            will not divide evenly. The first split gives [44] and the second gives
            [55,20]. It is easy to see how the splitting process eventually yields a
            vector that can be immediately merged with other sorted vectors.</p>

        <p>The visualization in <xref ref="sort_mergesort-animation"/> allows you to step through the algorithm. Red bars represent
            the element being looked at and blue represents the last element to look at
            during a pass.</p>

        <p>In order to analyze the <c>mergeSort</c> function, we need to consider the
            two distinct processes that make up its implementation. First, the vector
            is split into halves. We already computed (in a binary search) that we
            can divide a vector in half <m>\log n</m> times where <em>n</em> is the
            length of the vector. The second process is the merge. Each item in the
            vector will eventually be processed and placed on the sorted vector. So the
            merge operation which results in a vector of size <em>n</em> requires <em>n</em>
            operations. The result of this analysis is that <m>\log n</m> splits,
            each of which costs <m>n</m> for a total of <m>n\log n</m>
            operations. A merge sort is an <m>O(n\log n)</m> algorithm.</p>
        <p>Recall that the slicing operator is <m>O(k)</m> where k is the size
            of the slice. In order to guarantee that <c>mergeSort</c> will be
            <m>O(n\log n)</m> we will need to remove the slice operator. Again,
            this is possible if we simply pass the starting and ending indices along
            with the vector when we make the recursive call. We leave this as an
            exercise.</p>
        <p>It is important to notice that the <c>mergeSort</c> function requires extra
            space to hold the two halves as they are extracted with the slicing
            operations. This additional space can be a critical factor if the vector
            is large and can make this sort problematic when working on large data
            sets. In the case with using lists in python, the space complexity is <m>O(\log n)</m>.</p>
